        "article": "Lyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 \u2013 May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels. He wrote 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema.\nBorn and raised in upstate New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright.  He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper.  They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first Oz book in 1900.  While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a movie studio focused on children's films in Los Angeles, California.\nHis works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), and the ubiquity of clothes advertising (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).\n\n\n== Childhood and early life ==\nBaum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (n\u00e9e Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. \"Lyman\" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name \"Frank\".\n\nHis father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Frank was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at Peekskill Military Academy but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home.Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of The Rose Lawn Home Journal. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called The Stamp Collector, printed an 11-page pamphlet called Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory, and started a stamp dealership with  friends.At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg chicken. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, The Poultry Record, and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs.Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Theater ===\nBaum embarked on his lifetime infatuation\u2014and wavering financial success\u2014with the theater. A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater\u2014temporarily\u2014and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's dry goods company in Syracuse. This experience may have influenced his story \"The Suicide of Kiaros\", first published in the literary journal The White Elephant. A fellow clerk one day had been found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.\nBaum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks. In 1880, his father built him a theater in Richburg, New York, and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. The Maid of Arran proved a modest success, a melodrama with songs based on William Black's novel A Princess of Thule. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical musical, as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and operettas.\nOn November 9, 1882, Baum married Maud Gage, a daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a famous women's suffrage and feminist activist. While Baum was touring with The Maid of Arran, the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama Matches, destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including Matches, as well as costumes.\n\n\n=== The South Dakota years ===\nIn July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, Dakota Territory where he opened a store called \"Baum's Bazaar\". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store, so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer where he wrote the column Our Landlady. Following the death of Sitting Bull at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum urged the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below). On January 3, 1891, he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the Wounded Knee Massacre:\nThe Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination  [sic] of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.\nBaum's description of Kansas in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is based on his experiences in drought-ridden South Dakota. During much of this time, Matilda Joslyn Gage was living in the Baum household. While Baum was in South Dakota, he sang in a quartet which included James Kyle, who became one of the first Populist (People's Party) Senators in the U.S.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\n\nBaum's newspaper failed in 1891, and he, Maud, and their four sons moved to the Humboldt Park section of Chicago, where Baum took a job reporting for the Evening Post. Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called The Show Window, later known as the Merchants Record and Show Window, which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmas time fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former Show Window magazine is still currently in operation, now known as VMSD magazine (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati. In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing customers. He also had to work as a traveling salesman.\n\nIn 1897, he wrote and published Mother Goose in Prose, a collection of Mother Goose rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. Mother Goose was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his  sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator W. W. Denslow to publish Father Goose, His Book, a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children's book of the year.\n\n\n==== The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ====\n\nIn 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  to much critical acclaim and financial success. The book was the best-selling children's book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the Land of Oz.\n\n\n==== The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin's Musical Extravaganza ====\n\nTwo years after Wizard's publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer Paul Tietjens and director Julian Mitchell to produce a musical stage version of the book under Fred R. Hamlin. Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title \"The Wizard of Oz\"), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as Dorothy Gale, alongside David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone as the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.\nThe stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and Pastoria (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.\nBeginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled \"The Wizard of Oz\", rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the Hollywood film.\nBaum wrote a new Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz, with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled The Woggle-Bug, but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of Ozma of Oz, which eventually became The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer Oliver Morosco to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of The Patchwork Girl of Oz, but this was ultimately realized as a film.\n\n\n== Later life and work ==\nWith the success of Wizard on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published Dot and Tot of Merryland in 1901. The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with John R. Neill on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies without authorization.\nBaum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the Hotel del Coronado; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated. Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus and Queen Zixi of Ix. However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with The Master Key appearing on St. Nicholas Magazine's survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.\nIn 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying \u201cPedloe Island\u201d off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area.  Nevertheless, Baum stated to the press that he had discovered a Pedloe Island off the coast of California and that he had purchased it to be \"the Marvelous Land of Oz,\" intending it to be \"a fairy paradise for children.\"  Eleven year old Dorothy Talbot of San Francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on March 1, 1906, when the Palace of Oz was expected to be completed. Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E.  Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of The Woggle-Bug, which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.\n\nBecause of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a travelogue to Oz. However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. He claimed bankruptcy in August 1911. However, Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of Andrew Lang, whose portrait he kept in his study)\u2014all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.\nBaum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:\n\nEdith Van Dyne (the Aunt Jane's Nieces series)\nLaura Bancroft (The Twinkle Tales, Policeman Bluejay)\nFloyd Akers (The Boy Fortune Hunters series, continuing the Sam Steele series)\nSuzanne Metcalf (Annabel)\nSchuyler Staunton (The Fate of a Crown, Daughters of Destiny)\nJohn Estes Cooke (Tamawaca Folks)\nCapt. Hugh Fitzgerald (the Sam Steele series)Baum also anonymously wrote The Last Egyptian: A Romance of the Nile. He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman's men's social group The Uplifters, for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group's parodic by-laws. The group also included Will Rogers, but was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play's titles are known, but only The Uplift of Lucifer is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was The Tik-Tok Man of Oz (based on Ozma of Oz and the basis for Tik-Tok of Oz), a modest success in Hollywood that producer Oliver Morosco decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.\nIn 1914, Baum started his own film production company The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of Louis F. Gottschalk, Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by J. Farrell MacDonald, with casts that included Violet MacMillan, Vivian Reed, Mildred Harris, Juanita Hansen, Pierre Couderc, Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, J. Charles Haydon, and early appearances by Harold Lloyd and Hal Roach. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson's younger brother Harold Rosson was the cinematographer on The Wizard of Oz, released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children's film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of The Last Egyptian and made a film of it (portions of which are included in Decasia), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to Dramatic Feature Films and transfer of ownership to Frank Joslyn Baum did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays, but the stress probably took its toll on his health.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a stroke, slipped into a coma and died the following day, at the age of 62. His last words were spoken to his wife during a brief period of lucidity: \"Now we can cross the Shifting Sands.\"  He was buried in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.His final Oz book, Glinda of Oz, was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably Ruth Plumly Thompson, who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.\n\n\n== Baum's beliefs ==\n\n\n=== Literary ===\nBaum's avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other fairy tales was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, remake them in an American vein, update them, omit stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but the amount of it decreased as the series progressed; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.\nAnother traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on romance. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the only elements of romance lay in the background of the Tin Woodman and his love for Nimmie Amee, which explains his condition but does not affect the tale in any other way, and the background of Gayelette and the enchantment of the Winged monkeys. The only other stories with such elements were The Scarecrow of Oz and Tik-Tok of Oz, both of them were based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.\n\n\n=== Political ===\n\n\n==== Women's suffrage advocate ====\nWhen Baum lived in Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he was secretary of its Equal Suffrage Club, much of the politics in the Republican Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for women's suffrage. Susan B. Anthony visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.\nSally Roesch Wagner of The Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation published The Wonderful Mother of Oz, describing how Matilda Gage's feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Some of Baum's contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of The Marvelous Land of Oz. In this story, General Jinjur leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but Princess Ozma, who advocates gender equality, is ultimately placed on the throne. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1915 classic of feminist science fiction, Herland, bears strong similarities to The Emerald City of Oz(1910); the link between Baum and Gilman is considered to be Gage. Baum's stories outside of Oz also contain feminist or egalitarian themes. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including Aunt Jane's Nieces and The Flying Girl and its sequel. The Bluebird Books feature a girl sleuth.\n\n\n==== Racial views ====\nDuring the period surrounding the 1890 Ghost Dance movement and Wounded Knee Massacre, Baum wrote two editorials asserting that the safety of white settlers depended on the wholesale genocide of American Indians. These editorials were re-published in 1990 by sociologist Robert Venables of Cornell University, who argues that  Baum was not using sarcasm.The first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the Lakota Sioux holy man, Sitting Bull. The piece opined that with Sitting Bull's death, \"the nobility of the Redskin\" had been extinguished, and the safety of the frontier would not be established until there was \"total annihilation\" of the remaining Native Americans, who, he claimed, lived as \"miserable wretches.\" Baum said that their extermination should not be regretted, and their elimination would \"do justice to the manly characteristics\" of their ancestors.The Wounded Knee Massacre occurred nine days later; the second editorial was published on January 3, 1891. Baum alleged that General Nelson A. Miles' weak rule of the Native Americans had caused American soldiers to suffer a \"terrible loss of blood\", in a \"battle\" which had been a disgrace to the Department of War. He found that the \"disaster\" could have easily been prevented with proper preparations. Baum reiterated that he believed, due to the history of mistreatment of Native Americans, that the extermination of the \"untamed and untamable\" tribes was necessary to protect American settlers. Baum ended the editorial with the following anecdote: \"An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that 'when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.'\"In 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.The short story \"The Enchanted Buffalo\" claims to be a legend about a tribe of bison, and it states that a key element of it made it into the legends of Native American tribes. Baum mentions his characters' distaste for a Hopi snake dance in Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John, but he also deplores the horrible situation which exists on Indian reservations. Aunt Jane's Nieces on the Ranch features a hard-working Mexican in order to disprove Anglo stereotypes which portray Mexicans as lazy. Baum's mother-in-law and woman's suffrage leader Matilda Joslyn Gage strongly influenced his views. Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons in recognition of her outspoken respect and sympathy for Native American people.\n\n\n==== Political imagery in The Wizard of Oz ====\n\nNumerous political references to the \"Wizard\" appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article in 1964, the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended metaphor of the politics and characters of the 1890s. He paid special attention to the Populist metaphors and debates over silver and gold. Baum was a Republican and avid supporter of women's suffrage, and it is thought that he did not support the political ideals of either the Populist movement of 1890\u20131892 or the Bryanite silver crusade of 1896\u20131900. He published a poem in support of William McKinley.Since 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield's interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow's illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield wrote to The New York Times letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was \"not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories.\"Baum's newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children's books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum's Oz books after 1902. Baum was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to \"please children\".\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nBaum was originally a Methodist, but he joined the Episcopal Church in Aberdeen in order to participate in community theatricals. Later, he and his wife were encouraged to become members of the Theosophical Society in 1892 by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Baum's beliefs are frequently reflected in his writings; however, the only mention of a church in his Oz books is the porcelain one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Baums sent their older sons to \"Ethical Culture Sunday School\" in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.Writers including Evan I. Schwartz among others have suggested that Baum intentionally used allegory and symbolism in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to convey concepts that are central to spiritual teachings such as Theosophy and Buddhism. They postulate that the main characters\u2019 experiences in Oz represent the soul\u2019s journey toward enlightenment.  Schwartz specifically states that key plot elements of the book take \u201cthe reader on a journey guided by Eastern philosophy\u201d (Schwartz, p. 265).  An article in BBC Culture lists several allegorical interpretations of the book including that it may be viewed as a parable of Theosophy.  The article cites various symbols and their possible meanings, for example the Yellow Brick Road representing the \u2018Golden Path\u2019 in Buddhism, along which the soul travels to a state of spiritual realization.\nBaum\u2019s own writing suggests he believed the story may have been divinely inspired: \u201cIt was pure inspiration. It came to me right out of the blue. I think that sometimes the Great Author had a message to get across and He was to use the instrument at hand\u201d.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Works ==\nMother Goose in Prose (1897)\nBy the Candelabra's Glare (1898)\nFather Goose: His Book (1899)\nA New Wonderland (1900)\nThe Army Alphabet (1900)\nThe Navy Alphabet (1900)\nAmerican Fairy Tales (1901)\nThe Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1902)\nThe Boy Fortune Hunters in Egypt (1908)\nThe Boy Fortune Hunters in Panama (1908)\nFortune Hunters in China\nThe Boy Fortune Hunters in the South Seas (1911)\nThe Sea Fairies (1911)\nSky Island (1912)\nQueen Zixi of Ix (1905)\nThe Fate of a Crown (1905)\nSam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea (1906)\nDaughters of Destiny (novel) (1906)\nThe Last Egyptian (1907)\n\n\n=== Land of Oz works ===\n\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900)\nThe Marvelous Land of Oz (1904)\nQueer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz (1905, comic strip depicting 27 stories)\nThe Woggle-Bug Book (1905)\nOzma of Oz (1907)\nDorothy and the Wizard in Oz (1908)\nThe Road to Oz (1909)\nThe Emerald City of Oz (1910)\nThe Patchwork Girl of Oz (1913)\nLittle Wizard Stories of Oz (1913, collection of 6 short stories)\nTik-Tok of Oz (1914)\nThe Scarecrow of Oz (1915)\nRinkitink in Oz (1916)\nThe Lost Princess of Oz (1917)\nThe Tin Woodman of Oz (1918)\nThe Magic of Oz (1919, posthumously published)\nGlinda of Oz (1920, posthumously published)1921's The Royal Book of Oz was posthumously attributed to Baum but was entirely the work of Ruth Plumly Thompson.\n\n\n== Popular culture and legacy ==\nA 1970 episode of the long-running American Western anthology series Death Valley Days presents a highly romanticized portrayal of Baum's time in South Dakota. The comedic teleplay, titled \"The Wizard of Aberdeen\", stars Conlan Carter as Baum and Beverlee McKinsey as Maud. Although the 30-minute presentation touches on Baum's family life and his struggles in Aberdeen as a newspaper editor, it focuses principally on his storytelling to local children about characters in a distant land he initially refers to as \"Ooz\".\nJohn Ritter portrayed Baum in the television film The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story (1990).\nThe theme park Storybook Land, located in Aberdeen, South Dakota, features the Land of Oz, with characters and attractions from the books.\nIn 2013, Baum was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\nThe Woodsman, a 2012 stage play by Edward W. Hardy, tells the backstory of the Tin Man, using puppetry, movement, and music. The play has received multiple Off-Broadway productions, critical praise for Hardy's music, and won a 2016 Obie Award for Ortiz's puppet design.\nRusting Tin Man, a song about how Nick Chopper becomes the Tin Man, is a track from  The Woodsman (Original Off-Broadway Solo Recording) by Edward W.

        "article": "Poul William Anderson (November 25, 1926 \u2013 July 31, 2001) was an American science fiction author from the 1940s until the 21st century. Anderson wrote fantasy novels, historical novels, and short stories. His awards include seven Hugo Awards and three Nebula Awards.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPoul Anderson was born on November 25, 1926, in Bristol, Pennsylvania to Scandinavian parents. Shortly after his birth, his father, Anton Anderson moved the family to Texas, where they lived for over ten years. Following Anton Anderson's death, his widow took the children to Denmark. The family returned to the United States after the outbreak of World War II, settling eventually on a Minnesota farm.\nWhile he was an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota, Anderson's first stories were published by John W. Campbell in Astounding Science Fiction: \"Tomorrow's Children\" by Anderson and F. N. Waldrop in March 1947 and a sequel, \"Chain of Logic\" by Anderson alone, in July. He earned his B.A. in physics with honors but became a freelance writer after he graduated in 1948. He placed his third story in the December Astounding.Anderson married Karen Kruse in 1953 and moved with her to the San Francisco Bay area. Their daughter Astrid (now married to science fiction author Greg Bear) was born in 1954. They made their home in Orinda, California. Over the years Poul gave many readings at The Other Change of Hobbit bookstore in Berkeley; his widow later donated his typewriter and desk to the store.In 1965, Algis Budrys said that Anderson \"has for some time been science fiction's best storyteller\". He was a founding member of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) in 1966 and of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), also in the mid-1960s. The latter was a loosely-knit group of Heroic Fantasy authors led by Lin Carter, originally eight in number, with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone. Anderson was the sixth President of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, taking office in 1972.\nRobert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1985 novel The Cat Who Walks Through Walls to Anderson and eight of the other members of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy. The Science Fiction Writers of America made Anderson its 16th SFWA Grand Master in 1998 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2000, its fifth class of two deceased and two living writers. He died of prostate cancer on July 31, 2001, after a month in the hospital.

        "article": "Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 \u2013 June 11, 1936) was an American writer. He wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.\nHoward was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding, eventually taking up amateur boxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death.\nAlthough a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was Weird Tales, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly read author, with his best works still reprinted, and is one of the best-selling fantasy writers of all time.\nHoward's suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis her entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car and shot himself in the head.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nHoward was born January 22, 1906, in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard.  His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917).During Howard's youth his parents' relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money which may have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself.  Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son. She had a particularly strong influence on her son's intellectual growth. She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write.Other experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him. Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence.  As the son of the local doctor, Howard had frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom. Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world.  Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation. At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle.\n\n\n=== First writings ===\nVoracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, created in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. From the age of nine he began writing stories, mostly tales of historical fiction centering on Vikings, Arabs, battles, and bloodshed. One by one he discovered the authors who would influence his later work: Jack London and his stories of reincarnation and past lives, most notably The Star Rover (1915); Rudyard Kipling's tales of subcontinent adventures; the classic mythological tales collected by Thomas Bulfinch. Howard was considered by friends to be eidetic, and astounded them with his ability to memorize lengthy reams of poetry with ease after one or two readings.\n\nIn 1919, when Howard was thirteen, Dr. Howard moved his family to the Central Texas hamlet of Cross Plains, and there the family would stay for the rest of Howard's life.  Howard's father bought a house in the town with a cash down payment and made extensive renovations.  That same year, sitting in a library in New Orleans while his father took medical courses at a nearby college, Howard discovered a book concerned with the scant fact and abundant legends surrounding an indigenous culture in ancient Scotland called the Picts.In 1920, on February 17, the Vestal Well within the limits of Cross Plains struck oil and Cross Plains became an oil boomtown.  Thousands of people arrived in the town looking for oil wealth. New businesses sprang up from scratch and the crime rate increased to match.  Cross Plains' population quickly grew from 1,500 to 10,000, it suffered overcrowding, the traffic ruined its unpaved roads and vice crime exploded but it also used its new wealth on civic improvements, including a new school, an ice manufacturing plant, and new hotels.  Howard hated the boom and despised the people who came with it.  He was already poorly disposed towards oil booms as they were the cause of the constant traveling in his early years but this was aggravated by what he perceived to be the effect oil booms had on towns.\n\nAt fifteen Howard first sampled pulp magazines, especially Adventure and its star authors Talbot Mundy and Harold Lamb. The next few years saw him creating a variety of series characters. Soon he was submitting stories to magazines such as Adventure and Argosy. Rejections piled up, and with no mentors or instructions of any kind to aid him, Howard became a writing autodidact, methodically studying the markets and tailoring his stories and style to each.In the fall of 1922, when Howard was sixteen, he temporarily moved to a boarding house in the nearby city of Brownwood to complete his senior year of high school, accompanied by his mother. It was in Brownwood that he first met friends his own age who shared his interest not only for sports and history but also writing and poetry. The two most important of these, Tevis Clyde Smith and Truett Vinson, shared his Bohemian and literary outlook on life, and together they wrote amateur papers and magazines, exchanged long letters filled with poetry and existential thoughts on life and philosophy, and encouraged each other's writing endeavors.  Through Vinson, Howard was introduced to The Tattler, the newspaper of the Brownwood High School.  It was in this publication that Howard's stories were first printed.  The December 1922 issue featured two stories, \"'Golden Hope Christmas\" and \"West is West,\" which won gold and silver prizes respectively.Howard graduated from high school in May 1923 and moved back to Cross Plains. On his return to his home town, he engaged in a self-created regimen of exercise, including cutting down oak trees and chopping them into firewood every day, lifting weights, punching a bag and springing exercises; eventually building himself from a skinny teenager into a more muscled, burly form.\n\n\n=== Professional writer ===\n\nHoward spent his late teens working odd jobs around Cross Plains, all of which he hated. In 1924, Howard returned to Brownwood to take a stenography course at Howard Payne College, this time boarding with his friend Lindsey Tyson instead of his mother. Howard would have preferred a literary course but was not allowed to take one for some reason. Biographer Mark Finn suggests that his father refused to pay for such a non-vocational education. In the week of Thanksgiving that year, and after years of rejection slips and near acceptances, he finally sold a short caveman tale titled \"Spear and Fang\", which netted him the sum of $16 and introduced him to the readers of a struggling pulp called Weird Tales.Now that his career in fiction had begun, Howard dropped out of Howard Payne College at the end of the semester and returned to Cross Plains. Shortly afterwards, he received notice that another story, \"The Hyena,\" had been accepted by Weird Tales. During the same period, Howard made his first attempt to write a novel, a loosely autobiographical book modeled on Jack London's Martin Eden and titled Post Oaks & Sand Roughs. The book was otherwise of middling quality and was never published in the author's lifetime, but it is of interest to Howard scholars for the personal information it contains.  Howard's alter ego in this novel is Steve Costigan, a name he would use more than once in the future. The novel was finished in 1928, but not published until long after his death.Weird Tales paid on publication, meaning that Howard had no money of his own at this time.  To remedy this, he took a job writing oil news for the local newspaper Cross Plains Review at $5 per column.  It was not until July 1925 that Howard received payment for his first printed story.  Howard lost his job at the newspaper in the same year and spent one month working in a post office before quitting over the low wages. His next job, at the Cross Plains Natural Gas Company, did not last long due to his refusal to be subservient to his boss.  He did manual labor for a surveyor for a time before beginning a job as a stenographer for an oil company.In conjunction with his friend Tevis Clyde Smith, he dabbled heavily in verse, writing hundreds of poems and getting dozens published in Weird Tales and assorted poetry journals.  With poor sales, and many publishers recoiling from his subject matter, Howard ultimately judged poetry writing a luxury he could not afford, and after 1930 he wrote little verse, instead dedicating his time to short stories and higher-paying markets. Nevertheless, as a result of this apprenticeship, his stories increasingly took on the aura of \"prose-poems\" filled with hypnotic, dreamy imagery and a power lacking in most other pulp efforts of the time.Further story sales to Weird Tales were sporadic but encouraging, and soon Howard was a regular in the magazine. His first cover story was for \"Wolfshead\", a werewolf story published when he was only twenty. On reading \"Wolfshead\" in Weird Tales Howard became dismayed with his writing.  He quit his stenographer's job to work at Robertson's Drug Store, where he rose to become head soda jerk on $80 per week.  However, he resented the job itself and worked such long hours every day of the week that he became ill.  He relaxed by visiting the Neeb Ice House, to which he was introduced by an oil-field worker befriended at the drug store, to drink and began to take part in boxing matches.  These matches became an important part of his life; the combination of boxing and writing provided an outlet for his frustrations and anger.\n\n\n=== Sword and sorcery ===\n\nIn August 1926, Howard quit his exhausting job at the drug store and, in September, returned to Brownwood to complete his bookkeeping course.  It was during this August that he began working on the story that would become \"The Shadow Kingdom\", one of the most important works of his career.  While at college, Howard wrote for their newspaper, The Yellow Jacket.  One of the short stories printed in this newspaper was a comedy called \"Cupid vs. Pollux.\"  This story is Howard's earliest surviving boxing story known to exist; it is told in the first person, uses elements of a traditional tall-tale and is a fictionalized account of Howard (as \"Steve\") and his friend Lindsey Tyson (as \"Spike\") training for a fight.  This story and the elements it uses would also be important in Howard's literary future.In May 1927, after having to return home due to contracting measles and then being forced to retake the course, Howard passed his exams.  While waiting for the official graduation in August, he returned to writing, including a re-write of \"The Shadow Kingdom.\"  He rewrote it again in August and submitted it to Weird Tales in September.  This story was an experiment with the entire concept of the \"weird tale\"  horror fiction as defined by practitioners such as Edgar Allan Poe, A. Merritt, and H. P. Lovecraft, mixing elements of fantasy, horror and mythology with historical romance, action and swordplay into thematic vehicles never before seen, a new style of tale which ultimately became known as \"sword and sorcery\". Featuring Kull, a barbarian precursor to later Howard heroes such as Conan, the tale hit Weird Tales in August 1929 and received fanfare from readers. Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright bought the story for $100, the most Howard had earned for a story at this time, and several more Kull stories followed.  However, all but two were rejected, convincing Howard not to continue the series.\n\nIn March 1928, Howard salvaged and re-submitted to Weird Tales a story rejected by the more popular pulp Argosy, and the result was \"Red Shadows\", the first of many stories featuring the vengeful Puritan swashbuckler Solomon Kane. Appearing in the August 1928 issue of Weird Tales, the character was a big hit with readers and this was the first of Howard's characters to sustain a series in print beyond just two stories (seven Kane stories were printed in the 1928\u201332 period).  As the magazine published the Solomon Kane tale before Kull, this can be considered the first published example of sword and sorcery.1929 was the year Howard broke out into other pulp markets, rather than just Weird Tales.  The first story he sold to another magazine was \"The Apparition in the Prize Ring,\" a boxing-related ghost story published in the magazine Ghost Stories.  In July of the same year, Argosy finally published one of Howard's stories, \"Crowd-Horror\", which was also a boxing story.  Neither developed into ongoing series, however.\nAfter several minor successes and false starts, he struck gold again with a new series based on one of his favorite passions: boxing. July 1929 saw the debut of Sailor Steve Costigan in the pages of Fight Stories. A tough-as-nails, two-fisted mariner with a head of rocks and occasionally a heart of gold, Costigan began boxing his way through a variety of exotic seaports and adventure locales, becoming so popular in Fight Stories that the same editors began using additional Costigan episodes in their sister magazine Action Stories. The series saw a return to Howard's use of humor and (unreliable) first-person narration, with the combination of a traditional tall tale and slapstick comedy. Stories sold to Fight Stories provided Howard with a market just as stable as Weird Tales.Due to his success in Fight Stories, Howard was contacted by the publisher Street & Smith in February 1931 with a request to move the Steve Costigan stories to their own pulp Sport Story Magazine.  Howard refused but created a new, similar series just for them based on a boxer called Kid Allison.  Howard wrote ten stories for this series but Sport Story only published three of them.With solid markets now all buying up his stories regularly, Howard quit taking college classes, and indeed would never again work a regular job. At twenty-three years of age, from the middle of nowhere in Texas, he had become a full-time writer; he was making good money and his father began bragging about his success, not to mention buying multiple copies of his work in the pulps.Howard's \"Celtic phase\" began in 1930, during which he became fascinated by Celtic themes and his own Irish ancestry.  He shared this enthusiasm with Harold Preece, a friend made in Austin in the summer of 1927; Howard's letters to both Preece and Clyde Smith contain much Irish-related material and discussion.  Howard taught himself a little Gaelic, examined the Irish parts of his family history and began writing about Irish characters.  Turlogh Dubh O'Brien and Cormac Mac Art were created at this time, although he was not able to sell the latter's stories.When Farnsworth Wright started a new pulp in 1930 called Oriental Stories, Howard was overjoyed\u2014here was a venue where he could run riot through favorite themes of history and battle and exotic mysticism. During the four years of the magazine's existence, he crafted some of his very best tales, gloomy vignettes of war and rapine in the Middle and Far East during the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, tales that rival even his best Conan stories for their historical sweep and splendor. In addition to series characters such as Turlogh Dubh O'Brien and Cormac Fitzgeoffrey, Howard sold a variety of tales depicting various times and periods from the fall of Rome to the fifteenth century.  The magazine eventually ceased publication in 1934 due to the Depression, leaving several of Howard's stories aimed at this market unsold.\n\n\n=== Lovecraft Circle ===\nIn August 1930 Howard wrote a letter to Weird Tales praising a recent reprint of H. P. Lovecraft's \"The Rats in the Walls\" and discussing some of the obscure Gaelic references used within. Editor Farnsworth Wright forwarded the letter to Lovecraft, who responded warmly to Howard, and soon the two Weird Tales veterans were engaged in a vigorous correspondence that would last for the rest of Howard's life. By virtue of this, Howard quickly became a member of the \"Lovecraft Circle\", a group of writers and friends all linked via the immense correspondence of H. P. Lovecraft (who wrote over 100,000 letters in his lifetime), who made it a point to introduce his many like-minded friends to one another and encourage them to share stories, utilize each other's invented fictional trappings, and help each other succeed in the pulp field. In time this circle of correspondents has developed a legendary patina about it rivaling similar literary conclaves such as The Inklings, the Bloomsbury Group, and the Beats.\n\nHoward was given the affectionate nickname \"Two-Gun Bob\" by virtue of his long explications to Lovecraft about the history of his beloved Southwest, and during the ensuing years he contributed several notable elements to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos of horror stories (beginning with \"The Black Stone\", his Mythos stories also included \"The Cairn on the Headland\", \"The Children of the Night\" and \"The Fire of Asshurbanipal\"). He also corresponded with other \"Weird Tale\" writers such as Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, and E. Hoffmann Price.The correspondence between Howard and Lovecraft contained a lengthy discussion on a frequent element in Howard's fiction, barbarism versus civilization. Howard held that civilization was inherently corrupt and fragile. This attitude is summed up in his famous line from \"Beyond the Black River\": \"Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural.  It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph.\" Lovecraft held the opposite viewpoint, that civilization was the peak of human achievement and the only way forward. Howard countered by listing many historic abuses of the citizenry by so-called 'civilized' leaders. Howard initially deferred to Lovecraft but gradually asserted his own views, even coming to deride Lovecraft's opinions.In 1930, with his interest in Solomon Kane dwindling and his Kull stories not catching on, Howard applied his new sword-and-sorcery and horror experience to one of his first loves: the Picts. His story \"Kings of the Night\" depicted King Kull conjured into pre-Christian Britain to aid the Picts in their struggle against the invading Romans, and introduced readers to Howard's king of the Picts, Bran Mak Morn. Howard followed up this tale with the now-classic revenge nightmare \"Worms of the Earth\" and several other tales, creating horrific adventures tinged with a Cthulhu-esque gloss and notable for their use of metaphor and symbolism.With the onset of the Great Depression, many pulp markets reduced their schedules or went out of business entirely. Howard saw market after market falter and vanish.  Weird Tales became a bimonthly publication and pulps such as Fight Stories, Action Stories, and Strange Tales all folded.  Howard was further hit when his savings were wiped out in 1931 when the Farmer's National Bank failed, and again, after transferring to another bank, when that one failed as well.\n\n\n=== Conan ===\n\nEarly 1932 saw Howard taking one of his frequent trips around Texas. He traveled through the southern part of the state with his main occupation being, in his own words, \"the wholesale consumption of tortillas, enchiladas and cheap Spanish wine.\"  In Fredericksburg, while overlooking sullen hills through a misty rain, he conceived of the fantasy land of Cimmeria, a bitter hard northern region home to fearsome barbarians. In February, while in Mission, he wrote the poem Cimmeria.It was also during this trip that Howard first conceived of the character of Conan.  Later, in 1935, Howard claimed in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith that Conan \"simply grew up in my mind a few years ago when I was stopping in a little border town on the lower Rio Grande.\"  However, the character actually took nine months to develop.Howard had originally used the name \"Conan\" for a Gael reaver in a past-life-themed story he completed in October 1931, which was published in the magazine Strange Tales in June 1932.  Although the character swears by the god \"Crom\", that is his only link to the more famous successor character.Going back home he developed the idea, fleshing out a new invented world\u2014his Hyborian Age\u2014and populating it with all manner of countries, peoples, monsters, and magic. Howard loved history and enjoyed writing historical stories.  However, the research necessary for a purely historical setting was too time-consuming for him to engage in on a regular basis and still earn a living.  The Hyborian Age, with its varied settings similar to real places and eras of history, allowed him to write pseudo-historical fiction without such problems. He may have been inspired in the creation of his setting by Thomas Bulfinch's 1913 edition of his Bulfinch's Mythology called The Outline of Mythology, which contained stories from history and legend, including many which were direct influences on Howard's work.  Another potential inspiration is G. K. Chesterton's The Ballad of the White Horse and Chesterton's concept that \"it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment.\"By March, Howard had recycled an unpublished Kull story called \"By This Axe I Rule!\" into his first Conan story.  The central plot remains that of a barbarian having become king of a civilized country and a conspiracy to assassinate him.  However, he removed an entire subplot concerning a couple's romance and created a new one with a supernatural element; the story was re-titled \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", an element from this new subplot.  Howard immediately went on to write two more Conan stories. The first of these was \"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\", an inversion of the Greek myth surrounding Apollo and Daphne, set much earlier in Conan's life.  The last of the initial trio was \"The God in the Bowl\", which went through three drafts and has a slower pace than most Conan stories.  This one is a murder mystery filled with corrupt officials and serves as Conan's introduction into civilization, while showing that he is a more decent person than the civilized characters. Before the end of the month, he sent the first two stories to Weird Tales in the same package, with the third following a few days later.With these three completed he created an essay called \"The Hyborian Age\" in order to flesh out his setting in more detail.  There were four drafts of this essay, starting with a two-page outline and finishing as an 8,000-word essay. Howard supplemented this with two sketched maps and an additional short piece entitled \"Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age.\"\n\nIn a letter dated March 10, 1932, Farnsworth Wright rejected \"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\" but noted that \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" had \"points of real excellence\" and suggested changes.  \"The God in the Bowl\" would also be rejected and so a potential fourth Conan story concerning Conan as a thief was abandoned at the synopsis stage. Instead of abandoning the entire Conan concept, as had happened with previous failed characters, Howard rewrote \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" based on Wright's feedback and including material from his essay.  Both this revision and the next Conan story, \"The Tower of the Elephant\", sold with no problems.  Howard had written nine Conan stories before the first saw print.Conan first appeared to the public in Weird Tales in December 1932 and was such a hit that Howard was eventually able to place seventeen Conan stories in the magazine between 1933 and 1936. Howard then took a short break from Conan after his initial burst of stories, returning to the character in mid-1933.  These stories, his \"middle period,\" are routine and considered the weakest of the series.  Stories, such as \"Iron Shadows in the Moon\", were often simply Conan rescuing a damsel in distress from a monster in some ruins. While earlier Conan stories had three or four drafts, some in this period had only two including the final version.  \"Rogues in the House\" is the only Conan story to be completed in a single draft.  These stories sold easily and they include the first and second Conan stories to feature on the cover of Weird Tales, \"Black Colossus\" and \"Xuthal of the Dusk\".  Howard's motivation for quick and easy sales at this time was influenced by the collapse of some other markets, such as Fight Stories, in the Depression.Also in this period, Howard wrote the first of the James Allison stories, \"Marchers of Valhalla.\"  Allison is a disabled Texan who begins to recall his past lives, the first of which is in the later part of Howard's new Hyborian age. In a letter to Clark Ashton Smith in October 1933, he wrote that its sequel \"The Garden of Fear\" was \"dealing with one of my various conceptions of the Hyborian and post-Hyborian world.\"In May 1933, a British publisher, Denis Archer, contacted Howard about publishing a book in the United Kingdom. Howard submitted a batch of his best available stories, including \"The Tower of the Elephant\" and \"The Scarlet Citadel\", on June 15. In January 1934 the publisher rejected the collection but suggested a novel instead. Though the publisher was \"exceedingly interested\" in the stories, the rejection letter explained that there was a \"prejudice that is very strong over here just now against collections of short stories.\" The suggested novel, however, could be published by Pawling and Ness Ltd in a first edition of 5,000 copies for lending libraries.In late 1933 Howard returned to Conan, starting again slightly awkwardly with \"The Devil in Iron\".  However, this was followed with the beginning of the latter group of Conan stories which \"carry the most intellectual punch,\" starting with \"The People of the Black Circle\".\n\nHoward probably began to work on the novel in February 1934, starting to write Almuric (a non-Conan, sword and planet science fiction novel) but abandoned it half way.  This was followed by another abortive attempt at a novel, this time a Conan novel which later became Drums of Tombalku.  The third attempt at writing the novel was more successful, resulting in Howard's only Conan novel The Hour of the Dragon, which was probably started on or around March 17, 1934.  This novel combines elements of two previous Conan stories, \"Black Colossus\" and \"The Scarlet Citadel,\" with Arthurian myth and provides an overview of Conan and the Hyborian age for the new British audience.  Howard sent his final draft to Denis Archer on May 20, 1934. He had worked exclusively on the novel for two months, writing approximately 5,000 words per day, seven days a week.  Although he told acquaintances that he had little hope for this novel, he had put a lot of effort into it. However, the publisher went into receivership in late 1934, before it could print the novel.  The story was briefly held as part of the company's assets before being returned to Howard.  It was later printed in Weird Tales as a serial over five months, beginning with the December 1935 issue.Howard may have begun losing interest in Conan in late 1934, with a growing desire to write westerns.  He began to write, although never finished, a Conan story called \"Wolves Beyond the Border\".  This was the first Conan tale to have an explicit (Robert W. Chambers-influenced) American setting, although American themes had appeared earlier, and the only one in which Conan himself does not appear.  His next story was based on his unfinished material and became \"Beyond the Black River\" which not only used the different American-frontier setting but was also, in Howard's own words, a \"Conan yarn without sex interest.\"  In another novel twist, Conan and the other protagonists have, at best, a pyrrhic victory; this was rare for pulp magazines.  This was followed by another experimental Conan story, \"The Black Stranger\", with a similar setting.  The story was, however, rejected by Weird Tales, which was rare for later Conan stories.  Howard's next piece, \"The Man-Eaters of Zamboula\", was more formulaic and was accepted by the magazine with no problems.  Howard only wrote one more Conan story, \"Red Nails,\" which was influenced both by his personal experiences at the time and an extrapolation of his views on civilization.The character of Conan had a wide and enduring influence among other Weird Tales writers, including C. L. Moore and Fritz Leiber, and over the ensuing decades the genre of sword and sorcery grew up around Howard's masterwork, with dozens of practitioners evoking Howard's creation to one degree or another.\n\n\n=== New markets ===\nIn spring 1933, Howard started to place work with Otis Adelbert Kline, a former pulp writer, as his agent.  Kline encouraged him to try writing in other genres in order to expand into different markets.  Kline's agency was successful in finding outlets for more of Howard's stories and even placed works that had been rejected when Howard was marketing himself alone.  Howard continued to sell directly to Weird Tales, however.\n\nHoward wrote one of the first \"Weird Western\" stories ever created, \"The Horror from the Mound,\" published in the May 1932 issue of Weird Tales.  This genre acted as a bridge between his early \"weird\" stories (a contemporary term for horror and fantasy) and his later straight western tales.He tried writing detective fiction but hated reading mystery stories and disliked writing them; he was not successful in this genre. More successfully, in late 1933 Howard took a character conceived in his youth, El Borak, and began using him in mature, professional tales of World War I-era Middle Eastern adventure that landed in Top Notch, Complete Stories, and Thrilling Adventures.  The 1920s version was a treasure-hunting adventurer but the 1930s version, first seen in \"The Daughter of Erlik Khan\" in the December 1934 issue of Top-Notch, was a grim gun-fighter keeping the peace after having gone native in Afghanistan.  The stories have a lot in common with those of Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb and T. E. Lawrence, with Western themes and Howard's hardboiled style of writing. As with his other series, he created another character in the same vein, Kirby O'Donnell, but this character lacked the grim, western elements and was not as successful.In the years since Conan had been created, Howard found himself increasingly fascinated with the history and lore of Texas and the American Southwest. Many of his letters to H. P. Lovecraft ran for a dozen pages or more, filled with stories he had picked up from elderly Civil War veterans, Texas Rangers, and pioneers. His Conan stories began featuring western elements, most notably in \"Beyond the Black River\", \"The Black Stranger\", and the unfinished \"Wolves Beyond the Border\". By 1934 some of the markets killed off by the Depression had come back, and Weird Tales was over $1500 behind on payments to Howard. The author therefore stopped writing weird fiction and turned his attentions to this steadily growing passion.The first of Howard's most commercially successful series (within his own lifetime) was started in July 1933.  \"Mountain Man\" was the first of the Breckinridge Elkins stories, humorous westerns in a similar style to his earlier Sailor Steve Costigan stories and again featuring an exaggerated, cartoonish version of Howard himself as the main character.  Written as tall tales in the vein of Texas \"Tall Lying\" stories, the story first appeared in the March\u2013April 1934 issue of Action Stories and was so successful that other magazines asked Howard for similar characters.  Howard created Pike Bearfield for Argosy and Buckner J. Grimes for Cowboy Stories.  Action Stories published a new Elkins story every issue without fail until well after Howard's death.  At Kline's suggestion, he also created A Gent from Bear Creek, a Breckinridge Elkins novel comprising existing short stories and new material.Conan remained the only character that Howard ever spoke of with his friends in Texas and the only one in whom they seemed interested.  It is possible that Breckinridge Elkins and the other characters in his stories were too close to home for Howard to be entirely comfortable discussing them.In the spring of 1936, Howard sold a series of \"spicy\" stories to Spicy-Adventure Stories.  The \"spicy\" series of pulp magazines dealt in stories that were considered borderline softcore pornography at the time but are now similar to romance novels.  These stories, which Howard referred to as \"bubby-twisters\", featured the character Wild Bill Clanton and were published under the pseudonym Sam Walser.\n\n\n=== Novalyne Price ===\n\nHoward is only known to have had one girlfriend in his life, Novalyne Price.  Price was an ex-girlfriend of Tevis Clyde Smith, one of Howard's best friends, whom she had known since high school and they had remained friends after their relationship ended.  She first met Howard in spring 1933 when Howard was visiting Smith after driving his mother to a Brownwood clinic.  Howard and Smith drove to the Price farm and Smith introduced his friends to each other.  Price was an aspiring writer, had heard of Howard from Smith in the past and was enthusiastic to meet him in person.  However, he was not what she expected.  She wrote in her diary about this first meeting: \"This man was a writer! Him? It was unbelievable. He was not dressed as I thought a writer should dress.\" They parted after a drive and would not see each other again for over a year.In late 1934 Price got a job as a schoolteacher in Cross Plains High School through her cousin, the Head of the English department.  When Howard came up in conversation with her new colleagues she defended him from accusations of being a \"freak\" and \"crazy,\" then phoned his house and left a message.  This call was not returned so she tried a few more times.  Price visited the Howard house in person after having her telephone calls blocked by a passive aggressive Hester Howard.  After a drive through town they arranged their first date.Through much of the next two years they dated on and off, spending much time discussing writing, philosophy, history, religion, reincarnation and much else.  Both considered marriage but never at the same time.  Price became ill from overwork in mid-1935.  Her doctor, a friend of Howard's father, advised her to end the relationship and get a job in a different state. Despite agreeing to this, she met with Howard soon after being discharged.  Howard, however, was too preoccupied with the state of his mother's health to give her the attention she wanted.  Their relationship did not last much longer.Not considering herself to be in an exclusive relationship, Price began dating one of Howard's best friends, Truett Vinson.  Howard discovered his friends' relationship while he and Truett were on a week's trip together to New Mexico (the same trip which inspired a lot of the final Conan story \"Red Nails\").  The relationship between the couple was irrevocably scarred, but they continued visiting with each other as friends until May 1936, when Price left Cross Plains for Louisiana State University to get a graduate degree.  The two never spoke or wrote to each other again.In an effort to improve her memory and writing, Price began recording all her daily conversations into a journal, in the process preserving an intimate record of her time with Howard.  This was useful years later when she wrote of their relationship in a book called One Who Walked Alone, which was the basis for the 1996 film The Whole Wide World starring Vincent D'Onofrio as Howard and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Price.\n\n\n=== Death ===\n\nBy 1936, almost all of Howard's fiction writing was being devoted to westerns. The novel A Gent from Bear Creek was due to be published by Herbert Jenkins in England, and by all accounts it looked as if he was finally breaking out of the pulps and into the more prestigious book market. However, life was becoming especially difficult for Howard. All of his close friends had married and were immersed in their careers, Novalyne Price had left Cross Plains for graduate school, and his most reliable market, Weird Tales, had grown far behind on its payments. His home life was also falling apart. Having suffered from tuberculosis for decades, his mother was finally nearing death. The constant interruptions of care workers at home, combined with frequent trips to various sanatoriums for her care, made it nearly impossible for Howard to write.In hindsight, there were hints about Howard's plans. Several times in 1935\u201336, whenever his mother's health had declined, he made veiled allusions to his father about planning suicide, which his father did not understand at the time. He had made references when speaking to Novalyne Price about being in his \"sere and yellow leaf\". The words sounded familiar to her, but it was only in early June 1936 that she found the source in Macbeth:\nI have liv'd long enough: my way of lifeIs fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf;And that which should accompany old age,As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,I must not look to have; but, in their stead,Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.\nIn the weeks before his suicide, Howard wrote to Kline giving his agent instructions of what to do in case of his death, he wrote his last will and testament, and he borrowed a .380 Colt Automatic from his friend Lindsey Tyson. On June 10, he drove to Brownwood and bought a burial plot for the whole family. On the night before his suicide, when his father confirmed that his mother was finally dying, he asked where his father would go afterwards. Isaac Howard replied that he would go wherever his son went, thinking he meant to leave Cross Plains. It is possible that Howard thought his father would join him in ending their lives together as a family.\n\nIn June 1936, as Hester Howard slipped into her final coma, her son maintained a death vigil with his father and friends of the family, getting little sleep, drinking huge amounts of coffee, and growing more despondent. On the morning of June 11, 1936, Howard asked one of his mother's nurses, a Mrs. Green, if she would ever regain consciousness.  When she told him no, he walked out to his car in the driveway, took the pistol from the glove box, and shot himself in the head. His father and another doctor rushed out, but the wound was too grievous for anything to be done. Howard lived for another eight hours, dying at 4 pm; his mother died the following day. The story occupied the entirety of that week's edition of the Cross Plains Review, along with the publication of Howard's \"A Man-Eating Jeopard\". On June 14, 1936, a double funeral service was held at Cross Plains First Baptist Church, and both were buried in Greenleaf Cemetery in Brownwood, Texas.\n\n\n== Health ==\nRobert E. Howard's health, especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart, which he treated by taking Digoxin. The precise nature of Howard's mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide. Three main points of view exist: some have declared that Howard suffered from an Oedipal complex or similar; another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from major depressive disorder; the third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.\n\n\n== Character sketch ==\n\n\n=== Attitudes ===\nHoward's attitude towards race and racism is debated. Howard used race as shorthand for physical characteristics and motivation.  He would also employ some racial stereotypes, possibly for the sake of simplification.  He was also of the belief that, no matter who won the subsequent conflicts, it would only ever be a temporary victory. In \"Wings in the Night\", for instance, Howard writes that:\n\nThe ancient empires fall, the dark-skinned peoples fade and even the demons of antiquity gasp their last, but over all stands the Aryan barbarian, white-skinned, cold-eyed, dominant, the supreme fighting man of the earth.\nHoward became less racist as he grew older, due to several influences. Later works include more sympathetic black characters, as well as other minority groups, such as Jews. Significant works in terms of Howard's views on race are \"Black Canaan\" and \"The Last White Man\", which depict white protagonists at war with black characters defined by barbarity.Howard had feminist views, despite his era and location, which he espoused in both personal and professional life. Howard wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women. Strong female characters in Howard's works of fiction include the protofeminist Dark Agnes de Chastillon (first appearing in \"Sword Woman\", circa 1932\u20131934); the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel (\"The Isle of Pirates' Doom\", 1928), two pirates and Conan supporting characters, B\u00ealit (\"Queen of the Black Coast\", 1934) and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood (\"Red Nails\", 1936); as well as the Ukrainian mercenary Red Sonya of Rogatino (\"The Shadow of the Vulture\", 1934).Howard had a phobia of aging and old age, a frequent subject in his writings, where characters were always eternally youthful and vigorous. He often spoke of a desire to die young.\n\n\n=== Physical ===\nPhysically, Howard was tall and heavily built. He had a gentle, round face with a soft, deep voice. E. Hoffmann Price wrote that when he first met Howard in 1934 he \"was busy trying to combine two images, that of the actual man, and that of the man who loomed up in those stirring yarns. The synthesis was never effected. He was packed with the whimsy and poetry which rang out in his letters, and blazed up in much of his published fiction, but, as is usually the case with writers, his appearance belied him. His face was boyish, not yet having squared off into angles; his blue eyes slightly prominent, had a wide-openness which did not suggest anything of the man's keen wit and agile fancy. That first picture persists\u2014a powerful, solid, round-faced fellow, kindly and somewhat stolid seeming.\"\n\n\n=== Leisure activities ===\nHoward enjoyed listening to other people's stories. He listened to tales told by family members growing up and, as an adult, collected stories from any older people willing to tell them. Howard's parents were both natural storytellers of different kinds and he grew up in early twentieth century Texas, an environment in which the telling of tall tales was a standard form of entertainment. Howard himself was a natural storyteller and later a professional storyteller. Combined, this often led to Howard embellishing facts in his communication, not with an intention to deceive but just to make a better story. This can be a problem for biographers reading his works and letters with an aim to understand Howard himself.Howard had an almost photographic memory and could memorize long poems after only a few readings. Howard also enjoyed listening to music and drama on the radio. However his main interests were sports and politics, and he would listen to match reports and election results as they came in.After Howard bought a car in 1932, he and his friends took regular excursions across Texas and nearby states. His letters to Lovecraft also contain information about the history and geography he encountered on his journeys. Howard was also a practitioner and fan of boxing, as well as an avid weightlifter.\n\n\n== Writing ==\n\nHoward's first published poem was The Sea, in an early 1923 issue of local newspaper The Baylor United Statement. His first published story was \"Spear and Fang\", sold in late November 1924 and published in the July 1925 issue of the pulp magazine Weird Tales.  However, Howard's first real success was the Sailor Steve Costigan series of humorous boxing stories, beginning with \"The Pit of the Serpent\" published in the July 1929 issue of the pulp magazine Fight Stories.\n\n\n=== Styles and themes ===\n\nHoward's distinctive literary style relies on a combination of existentialism, poetic lyricism, violence, grimness, humour, burlesque, and a degree of hardboiled realism.  Howard's background in Texan tall tales is the source of the rhythm, drive and authenticity of his work. Howard used an economy of words to sketch out scenes in his stories; his ability to do so has been attributed to his skill with, and experience of, both tall tales and poetry. The tone of Howard's works, especially in the Conan stories, is hardboiled and dark.  This is contrasted with the fantastic elements contained within the stories.  Direct experience of the oil booms in early twentieth-century Texas influenced Howard's view of civilization.  The benefits of progress came with lawlessness and corruption.  One of the most common themes in Howard's writing is based on his view of history, a repeating pattern of civilizations reaching their peak, becoming decadent, decaying and then being conquered by another people.  Many of his works are set in the period of decay or among the ruins the dead civilization leaves behind.\n\n\n=== Influence and influences ===\n\nThe oil boom in Texas was \"one of the most powerful influences on [Howard's] life and art\", albeit one that he hated.  Howard grew to despise the oil industry along with everyone and everything associated with it.  The oil boom heavily influenced Howard's view of civilization as a constant cycle of boom and bust in the same manner as the oil industry in contemporary Texas.  A town such as Cross Plains was built by pioneers. The boom brought civilization in the form of people and investment but also social breakdown.  The oil people contributed little or nothing to the town in the long term and eventually left for the next oil field.  This led Howard to see civilization as corrupting and society as a whole in decay.Howard first bought a pulp magazine, a copy of Adventure, when he was fifteen.  The stories and writers featured in this magazine were a strong influence on Howard.  In the same year, he sent his first story, \"Bill Smalley and the Power of the Human Eye\", to the magazine, although it was rejected.  Despite repeated attempts during his life, Howard never sold a story to Adventure.Howard was both influenced by and an influence on his friend H. P Lovecraft.  Many ideas that he discussed in his letters to Lovecraft were repeated in his fiction and the discussion with a fellow professional writer was useful to him.  For his part, Lovecraft began to include Howardian action sequences in his own work, for example in \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\".  Much of 1931 was spent by Howard attempting to mimic Lovecraft's style.  After that year, he had absorbed the parts of it that worked best for him and made them his own.Another inspiration for Howard was theosophy and the theories of Helena Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot, who described lost civilizations, ancient wisdom, races, magic and sunken continents and the lands of Lemuria, Atlantis and Hyperborea, and also influenced other writers of weird fiction.Howard influenced and inspired later writers including Samuel R. Delany, David Gemmell, Michael Moorcock, Matthew Woodring Stover, Charles R. Saunders, Karl Edward Wagner, Paul Kearney, Steven Erikson, Joe R. Lansdale, and William King. He also has an influence on the field of fantasy fiction rivaled only by J. R. R. Tolkien and Tolkien's similarly inspired creation of the modern genre of high fantasy.\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nCriticism of Robert E. Howard and his work often turns towards biographical details and \"backhanded compliment[s].\" Some imply that Howard was an uneducated idiot savant and that his success was due more to luck than skill.The first professional critic to comment on Howard's work was Hoffman Reynolds Hays, reviewing the Arkham House collection Skull-Face and Others in The New York Times Book Review.  Under the title \"Superman on a Psychotic Bender\", Hays wrote, \"Howard used a good deal of the Lovecraft cosmogony and demonology, but his own contribution was a sadistic conqueror who, when cracking heads did not solve his difficulties, had recourse to magic and the aid of Lovecraft's Elder Gods. The stories are written on a competent pulp level (a higher level, by the way, than that of some best sellers) and are allied to the Superman genre which pours forth in countless comic books and radio serials.\" Hays then moved on to Howard himself and the genre in which he wrote:\n\nA sensitive boy, he was apparently bullied by his schoolmates. ... Howard's heroes were consequently wish-projections of himself.  All of the frustrations of his own life were conquered in a dream world of magic and heroic carnage.  In exactly the same way Superman compensates for all the bewilderment and frustration in which the semi-literate product of the Industrial age finds himself enmeshed. The problem of evil is solved by an impossibly omnipotent hero. ... Thus the hero-literature of the pulps and the comics is symptomatic of a profound contradiction.  On the one hand it is testimony to insecurity and apprehension, and on the other it is a degraded echo of the epic.  But the ancient hero story was a glorification of significant elements in the culture that produced it.  Mr. Howard's heroes project the immature fantasy of a split mind and logically pave the way to schizophrenia.\nIn a review of Michel Houellebecq's essay \"H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life\" published in the Los Angeles Times, April 17, 2005, Stephen King implies that Howard did not work at his craft and was merely pastiching Lovecraft.  King described his disapproval of the sword and sorcery genre, and superheroes, in his book on writing Danse Macabre: \"[It] is not fantasy at its lowest, but it still has a pretty tacky feel. ... Sword and sorcery novels and stories are tales of power for the powerless. The fellow who is afraid of being rousted by those young punks who hang around his bus stop can go home at night and imagine himself wielding a sword, his potbelly miraculously gone, his slack muscles magically transmuted into those \"iron thews\" which have been sung and storied in the pulps for the last fifty years.\"  On Howard in particular, he wrote:\n\nHoward overcame the limitations of his puerile material by the force and fury of his writing and by his imagination, which was powerful beyond his hero Conan's wildest dreams of power. In his best work, Howard's writing seems so highly charged with energy that it nearly gives off sparks. Stories such as \"The People of the Black Circle\" glow with the fierce and eldritch light of his frenzied intensity. At his best, Howard was the Thomas Wolfe of fantasy, and most of his Conan tales seem to almost fall over themselves in their need to get out. Yet his other work was either unremarkable or just abysmal.\nAn exception to this, in King's opinion (again from Danse Macabre) was the author's Southern Gothic horror story \"Pigeons From Hell.\"  King referred to this work as \"one of the finest horror stories of our century.\"\nIn the foreword to \"Two-Gun Bob\", a collection of essays on the subject of Howard, fellow fantasy fiction writer, Michael Moorcock, wrote: \"The ability to paint a complex scene with a few expert brushstrokes remains Howard's greatest talent, and such talent can't, of course, ever be taught.\"  Howard scholar Rob Roehm considers the use of the phrase \"can't ever be taught\" to be a variation on the recurrent theme of Howard's lack of skill or training.  Moorcock's foreword goes on \"[Howard's] greatest hero, Conan the Barbarian, is his best, created from whole cloth, with a nod to Natty Bumppo and Tarzan of the Apes, and most closely representing the kind of person Howard, home-bound, mother-worshipping, suspicious of big cities, would in his dreams most like to be.\"  Roehm counters that none of the assertions made about Howard in that comment are true, although none of them are unique to Moorcock either.  In Wizardry & Wild Romance, Moorcock has also written both that Howard \"brought a brash, tough element to the epic fantasy that did as much to change the course of the American school away from previous writing and static imagery as Hammett, Chandler and the Black Mask pulp writers were to change the course of the American detective fiction\" and that he \"was never a commercially successful writer in his lifetime. His brash, hasty, careless style did not lend itself to the classier pulps. Most of his work appeared in the cheapest of them.\"Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi wrote, in his biography H. P. Lovecraft: A Life, that \"The bulk of Howard's fiction is subliterary hackwork that does not even begin to approach genuine literature\" and \"The simple fact is, however, that his views are not of any great substance or profundity and that Howard's style is crude, slip-shod, and unwieldy. It is all just pulp\u2014although, perhaps, a somewhat superior grade of pulp than the average.\"\n\n\n=== Earnings ===\nThe following table shows Howard's earnings from writing throughout his career, with appropriate milestones and events noted by each year. During the Depression, Howard earned more than anyone else in Cross Plains. When Howard died, Weird Tales still owed him between $800 and $1,300. (Adjusted for inflation, this amount would be equivalent to between $15,622 and $25,386.)\n\n\n=== Letters ===\nThree publishing houses have put out collections of Howard's letters. In 1989 and 1991, Necronomicon Press published Robert E. Howard: Selected Letters in two volumes (1923\u20131930 and 1931\u20131936) edited by Glenn Lord with Rusty Burke, S. T. Joshi, and Steve Behrends. In 2007 and 2008, The Robert E. Howard Foundation Press published a three volume set (1923\u20131929, 1930\u20131932, and 1933\u20131936) titled The Collected Letters of Robert E. Howard, edited by Rob Roehm. Additionally, in 2009, Hippocampus Press published two volumes (1930\u20131932 and 1933\u20131936) of Howard's correspondence with H. P. Lovecraft as A Means to Freedom: The Letters of H.P. Lovecraft & Robert E. Howard, edited by S. T. Joshi, David Schultz, and Rusty Burke.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nRobert E. Howard's legacy extended after his death in 1936.  Howard's most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond.  Howard's critical reputation suffered at first but over the decades works of Howard scholarship have been published.  The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp's Dark Valley Destiny (1983) which was followed by other works, including Don Herron's The Dark Barbarian (1984) and Mark Finn's Blood & Thunder (2006).  Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship.\nFollowing Robert E. Howard's death, the courts granted his estate to his father, who continued to work with Howard's literary agent Otis Adelbert Kline.  Dr. Isaac Howard passed the rights on to his friend Dr. Pere Kuykendall, who passed them to his wife, Alla Ray Kuykendall, and daughter, Alla Ray Morris.  Morris left the rights to the widow of her cousin, Zora Mae Bryant, who gave control to her children, Jack Baum and Terry Baum Rogers.  The Baums eventually sold their rights to the Swedish (now US) company Paradox Entertainment.\nHoward's first published novel, A Gent from Bear Creek, was printed in Britain one year after his death.  This was followed in the United States by a collection of Howard's stories, Skull-Face and Others (1946) and then the novel Conan the Conqueror (1950).  The success of Conan the Conqueror led to a series of Conan books from publisher Gnome Press, the later editor of which was L. Sprague de Camp.  The series led to the first Conan pastiche, the novel The Return of Conan by de Camp and Swedish Howard fan Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg. De Camp eventually achieved control over the Conan stories and Conan brand in general.  Oscar Friend took over from Kline as literary agent and he was followed by his daughter Kittie West.  When she closed the agency in 1965, a new agent was required.  De Camp was offered the role but he recommended Glenn Lord instead.  Lord began as a fan of Howard and had re-discovered many unpublished pieces that would otherwise have been lost, printing them in books such as Always Comes Evening (1957) and his own magazine The Howard Collector (1961\u20131973).  He became responsible for the non-Conan works and later restored, textually-pure versions of the Conan stories themselves.\nIn 1966, de Camp made a deal with Lancer Books to republish the Conan series, which led to the \"First Howard Boom\" of the 1970s; their popularity was enhanced by the cover artwork of Frank Frazetta on most of the volumes. Many of his works were reprinted (some printed for the first time) and they expanded into other media such as comic books and films.  The Conan stories were increasingly edited by de Camp and the series was extended by pastiches until they replaced the original stories.  In response, a puristic movement grew up demanding Howard's original, un-edited stories. The first boom ended in the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the \"Second Howard Boom\" occurred.  This saw the printing of new collections of Howard's work, with the restored texts desired by purists.  As before, the boom led to new comic books, films and computer games.  Howard's house in Cross Plains has been converted into the Robert E. Howard Museum, which has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe works of Robert E. Howard have been adapted into multiple media, such as the two Conan films released in the 1980s starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. In addition to the Conan films, other adaptations have included Kull the Conqueror (1997) and Solomon Kane (2009). In television, the anthology series Thriller (1961) led the adaptations with an episode based on the short story \"Pigeons from Hell\". The bulk of the adaptations have, however, been based on Conan with two animated and one live action series. Multiple audio dramas have been adapted, from professional audio books and plays to LibriVox recordings of works in the public domain. Computer games have focussed on Conan, beginning with Conan: Hall of Volta (1984) and continuing on to the MMO Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures (2008). The first table-top roleplaying game based on Howard's works was TSR's \"Conan Unchained!\" (1984) for their game Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. The first comic book adaptation was in the Mexican Cuentos de Abuelito \u2013 La Reina de la Costa Negra No. 17 (1952).  Howard-related comic books continued to be published to the present day.\nHoward is an ongoing inspiration for and influence on heavy metal music. Several bands have adapted Howard's works to tracks or entire albums. The British metal band Bal-Sagoth is named after Howard's story \"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth\".\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nRobert E.

        "article": "James Oliver Rigney Jr. (October 17, 1948 \u2013 September 16, 2007), better known by his pen name Robert Jordan, was an American author of epic fantasy. He is known best for his series  The Wheel of Time (finished by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death) which comprises 14 books and a prequel novel. He is one of several writers to have written original Conan the Barbarian novels; his are considered some of the best of the non-Robert E. Howard efforts by fans. Jordan also published historical fiction using the pseudonym Reagan O'Neal, a western as Jackson O'Reilly, and dance criticism as Chang Lung. Jordan claimed to have ghostwritten an \"international thriller\" that is still believed to have been written by someone else.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJordan was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He went to Clemson University after high school, but dropped out after one year and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War as a helicopter gunner. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with \"V\" and oak leaf cluster, and two Vietnamese Gallantry Crosses with palm.After returning from Vietnam in 1970, Jordan studied physics at The Citadel. He graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree and began working for the U.S. Navy as a nuclear engineer. He began writing in 1977.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJordan was a history buff and enjoyed hunting, fishing, sailing, poker, chess, pool, and pipe-collecting. He described himself as a \"High Church\" Episcopalian and received communion more than once a week. He lived with his wife, Harriet McDougal, who works as a book editor (currently with Tor Books; she was also Jordan's editor) in a house built in 1797.\n\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nOn March 23, 2006, Jordan disclosed that he had been diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis and that, with treatment, his median life expectancy was four years. In a separate weblog post, he encouraged his fans not to worry about him and stated that he intended to have a long and creative life.He began chemotherapy at Mayo Clinic during early April 2006. He participated with a study of the drug Revlimid, which had been approved recently for multiple myeloma but not yet tested for primary amyloidosis.Jordan died on September 16, 2007, and his funeral service was on September 19, 2007. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the churchyard of St. James Church in Goose Creek, outside Charleston, South Carolina.Jordan's papers can be found in the special collections of the College of Charleston.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== The Wheel of Time ===\n\nJordan published 11 books of a total 14 in the main sequence of the Wheel of Time series. Reviewers and fans of the earlier books noted a slowing of the pace of events in the last few installments written solely by Jordan owing to the expansion of scale of the series as a whole. Because of his health problems, Jordan did not work at full force on the final installment A Memory of Light (later split into three volumes beginning with The Gathering Storm), but blog entries confirmed that he continued work on it until his death, and he shared all of the significant plot details with his family not long before he died. He maintained that in doing so the book will get published even if \"the worst actually happens\". On December 7, 2007, Tor Books announced that Brandon Sanderson had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time series. Harriet McDougal, Jordan's widow, chose him after reading Mistborn: The Final Empire.\nAll paperback (PB) page totals given are for the most widely available mass-market paperback editions. The page count for the hardback (HB) editions do not include glossary or appendix page counts.\nThe World of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time is an encyclopedia for the series about the unnamed world where the plot takes place, which is often referred by fans of the series as the World of the Wheel. It is published in the United States by Tor Books and in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books. The bulk of the text was written by Teresa Patterson based on notes and information provided by Jordan, who also served as overall editor on the project. While the information in the guide is broadly canonical, the book is deliberately written with vague, biased or even downright false (or guessed) information in places, as Patterson felt this would reflect a key theme of the series (the mutability of knowledge across time and distance).\n\n\n=== Conan the Barbarian ===\n\nJordan was one of several writers who has written Conan the Barbarian stories. When Tom Doherty obtained the rights, he needed a novel very quickly, so Jordan's wife Harriet McDougal recommended him because she knew he had written his first novel, Warriors of the Altaii, in thirteen days.\n\nSo he thought I could write something fast, and he was right, and I liked it. It was fun writing something completely over the top, full of purple prose, and in a weak moment I agreed to do five more and the novelization of the second Conan movie. I've decided that those things were very good discipline for me. I had to work with a character and a world that had already been created and yet find a way to say something new about the character and the world. That was a very good exercise.\nConan the Invincible (1982)\nConan the Defender (1982)\nConan the Unconquered (1983)\nConan the Triumphant (1983)\nConan the Magnificent (1984)\nConan the Destroyer (1984) (adaptation of the movie of the same title)\nConan the Victorious (1984)They were packed into two separate volumes par Conan the Destroyer:\n\nThe Conan Chronicles\nThe Further Chronicles of Conan (The Conan Chronicles II in the UK, different contents)Jordan also compiled a well-known Conan Chronology.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Robert Jordan\".

        "article": "Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (; Arabic: \u0635\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a\u064a, romanized: \u1e62add\u0101m \u1e24usayn \u02bfAbd al-Maj\u012bd al-Tikr\u012bt\u012b; 28 April 1937 \u2013 30 December 2006) was an Iraqi politician who served as the fifth president of Iraq from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003. A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization, the Iraqi Ba'ath Party\u2014which espoused Ba'athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism\u2014Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup (later referred to as the 17 July Revolution) that brought the party to power in Iraq.\nAs vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company and independent banks, eventually leaving the banking system insolvent due to inflation and bad loans. Through the 1970s, Saddam consolidated his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy grow rapidly. Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs, a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.Saddam formally took power in 1979, although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years. He suppressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively, and maintained power during the Iran\u2013Iraq War and the Gulf War. He ran a repressive authoritarian government, which several analysts have described as totalitarian, although the applicability of that label has been contested. Saddam's rule was marked by numerous human rights abuses, including an estimated 250,000 arbitrary killings and bloody invasions of neighboring Iran and Kuwait.In 2003, a coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq to depose Saddam. U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair  erroneously accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to Al-Qaeda. Saddam's Ba'ath party was disbanded and the country's first democratic elections were held. After his capture on 13 December 2003, the trial of Saddam Hussein took place under the Iraqi Interim Government. On 5 November 2006, Saddam was convicted by an Iraqi court of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'a and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on 30 December 2006.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSaddam's brother and father died of cancer before his birth. These deaths made Saddam's mother, Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat, so depressed that she attempted to abort her pregnancy and commit suicide. When her son Saddam was born on 28 April 1937 in Awja, a small village near Tikrit, Subha \"would have nothing to do with him,\" and Saddam was taken in by an uncle.His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers through this marriage. His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return and, according to a psychological profile created by the CIA, beat him regularly, sometimes to wake him up. At about age 10, Saddam fled the family and returned to live in Baghdad with his uncle Khairallah Talfah, who became a fatherly figure to Saddam. Talfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout Sunni Muslim and a veteran of the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War between Iraqi nationalists and the United Kingdom, which remained a major colonial power in the region. Talfah later became the mayor of Baghdad during Saddam's time in power, until his notorious corruption compelled Saddam to force him out of office.Later in his life, relatives from his native Tikrit became some of his closest advisors and supporters. Under the guidance of his uncle, he attended a nationalistic high school in Baghdad. After secondary school, Saddam studied at an Iraqi law school for three years, dropping out in 1957 at the age of 20 to join the revolutionary pan-Arab Ba'ath Party, of which his uncle was a supporter. During this time, Saddam apparently supported himself as a secondary school teacher. Ba'athist ideology originated in Syria and the Ba'ath Party had a large following in Syria at the time, but in 1955 there were fewer than 300 Ba'ath Party members in Iraq and it is believed that Saddam's primary reason for joining the party as opposed to the more established Iraqi nationalist parties was his familial connection to Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and other leading Ba'athists through his uncle.\n\nRevolutionary sentiment was characteristic of the era in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. In Iraq progressives and socialists assailed traditional political elites (colonial-era bureaucrats and landowners, wealthy merchants and tribal chiefs, and monarchists). Moreover, the pan-Arab nationalism of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt profoundly influenced young Ba'athists like Saddam. The rise of Nasser foreshadowed a wave of revolutions throughout the Middle East in the 1950s and 1960s, with the collapse of the monarchies of Iraq, Egypt, and Libya. Nasser inspired nationalists throughout the Middle East by fighting the British and the French during the Suez Crisis of 1956, modernizing Egypt, and uniting the Arab world politically. His father-in-law, Khairallah Talfah, was reported to have served five years in prison for his role in fighting against Great Britain in the 1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat and Anglo-Iraqi War, and often mentored and told tales of his exploits to the young Saddam.In 1958, a year after Saddam had joined the Ba'ath party, army officers led by General Abd al-Karim Qasim overthrew Faisal II of Iraq in the 14 July Revolution.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\n\nThe Ba'ath Party was originally represented in Qasim's cabinet. The party turned against him for his refusal to join Gamal Abdel Nasser's United Arab Republic (UAR). To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism. Later that year, the Ba'ath Party leadership was planning to assassinate Qasim. Saddam was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba'ath Party was more of an ideological experiment than a strong anti-government fighting machine. The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam fit the bill. The choice of Saddam was, according to journalist Con Coughlin, \"hardly surprising.\" The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser's, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in Damascus, which was then part of the UAR. Per Con Coughlin, \"no evidence has ever been produced to implicate Nasser directly in the plot.\" Saddam himself is not believed to have received any training outside of Iraq, as he was a late addition to the assassination team.The assassins planned to ambush Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959: one man was to kill those sitting at the back of the car, the rest killing those in front. During the ambush it is claimed that Saddam began shooting prematurely, which disorganized the whole operation. Qasim's chauffeur was killed, and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder. The assassins believed they had killed him and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived. At the time of the attack the Ba'ath Party had fewer than 1,000 members. Saddam's role in the failed assassination became a crucial part of his public image for decades. Kanan Makiya recounts:\n\nThe man and the myth merge in this episode. His biography\u2014and Iraqi television, which stages the story ad nauseam\u2014tells of his familiarity with guns from the age of ten; his fearlessness and loyalty to the party during the 1959 operation; his bravery in saving his comrades by commandeering a car at gunpoint; the bullet that was gouged out of his flesh under his direction in hiding; the iron discipline that led him to draw a gun on weaker comrades who would have dropped off a seriously wounded member of the hit team at a hospital; the calculating shrewdness that helped him save himself minutes before the police broke in leaving his wounded comrades behind; and finally the long trek of a wounded man from house to house, city to town, across the desert to refuge in Syria.\nSome of the plotters (including Saddam) quickly managed to leave the country for Syria, the spiritual home of Ba'athist ideology. There Saddam was given full membership in the party by Michel Aflaq. Some members of the operation were arrested and taken into custody by the Iraqi government. At the show trial, six of the defendants were given death sentences; for unknown reasons the sentences were not carried out. Aflaq, the leader of the Ba'athist movement, organized the expulsion of leading Iraqi Ba'athist members, such as Fuad al-Rikabi, on the grounds that the party should not have initiated the attempt on Qasim's life. At the same time, Aflaq secured seats in the Iraqi Ba'ath leadership for his supporters, one of them being Saddam. Saddam moved from Syria to Egypt itself in February 1960, and he continued to live there until 1963, graduating from high school in 1961 and unsuccessfully pursuing a law degree.Army officers with ties to the Ba'ath Party overthrew Qasim in the Ramadan Revolution coup of February 1963. Ba'athist leaders were appointed to the cabinet and Abdul Salam Arif became president. Arif dismissed and arrested the Ba'athist leaders later that year in the November 1963 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat. Being exiled in Egypt at the time, Saddam played no role in the 1963 coup or the brutal anti-communist purge that followed; although he returned to Iraq after the coup, Saddam remained \"on the fringes of the newly installed Ba'thi administration and [had] to content himself with the minor position of a member of the Party's central bureau for peasants,\" in the words of Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi. Unlike during the Qasim years, Saddam remained in Iraq following Arif's anti-Ba'athist purge in November 1963, and became involved in planning to assassinate Arif. In marked contrast to Qasim, Saddam knew that he faced no death penalty from Arif's government and knowingly accepted the risk of being arrested rather than fleeing to Syria again. Saddam was arrested in October 1964 and served approximately two years in prison before escaping in 1966. In 1966, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr appointed him Deputy Secretary of the Regional Command. Saddam, who would prove to be a skilled organizer, revitalized the party. He was elected to the Regional Command, as the story goes, with help from Michel Aflaq\u2014the founder of Ba'athist thought. In September 1966, Saddam initiated an extraordinary challenge to Syrian domination of the Ba'ath Party in response to the Marxist takeover of the Syrian Ba'ath earlier that year, resulting in the Party's formalized split into two separate factions. Saddam then created a Ba'athist security service, which he alone controlled.In July 1968, Saddam participated in a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif, Salam Arif's brother and successor. While Saddam's role in the coup was not hugely significant (except in the official account), Saddam planned and carried out the subsequent purge of the non-Ba'athist faction led by Prime Minister Abd ar-Razzaq an-Naif, whose support had been essential to the coup's success. According to a semi-official biography, Saddam personally led Naif at gunpoint to the plane that escorted him out of Iraq. Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul. Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam clearly had become the moving force behind the party.\n\n\n=== Political program ===\n In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally al-Bakr's second-in-command, Saddam built a reputation as a progressive, effective politician. At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.\nAfter the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant. The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.Saddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.\nAt the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the 1973 energy crisis, and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.\n\nWithin just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,\" and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).With the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based Iraqi economy. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.\nThe oil revenue benefited Saddam politically. According to The Economist, \"Much as Adolf Hitler won early praise for galvanizing German industry, ending mass unemployment and building autobahns, Saddam earned admiration abroad for his deeds. He had a good instinct for what the \"Arab street\" demanded, following the decline in Egyptian leadership brought about by the trauma of Israel's six-day victory in the 1967 war, the death of the pan-Arabist hero, Gamal Abdul Nasser, in 1970, and the \"traitorous\" drive by his successor, Anwar Sadat, to sue for peace with the Jewish state. Saddam's self-aggrandizing propaganda, with himself posing as the defender of Arabism against Jewish or Persian intruders, was heavy-handed, but consistent as a drumbeat. It helped, of course, that his mukhabarat (secret police) put dozens of Arab news editors, writers and artists on the payroll.\"\n\nIn 1972, Saddam signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union. According to historian Charles R. H. Tripp, the treaty upset \"the U.S.-sponsored security system established as part of the Cold War in the Middle East. It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States.\" In response, the U.S. covertly financed Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani during the Second Iraqi\u2013Kurdish War; the Kurds were defeated in 1975, leading to the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians.Saddam focused on fostering loyalty to the Ba'athists in the rural areas. After nationalizing foreign oil interests, Saddam supervised the modernization of the countryside, mechanizing agriculture on a large scale, and distributing land to peasant farmers. The Ba'athists established farm cooperatives and the government also doubled expenditures for agricultural development in 1974\u20131975. Saddam's welfare programs were part of a combination of \"carrot and stick\" tactics to enhance support for Saddam. The state-owned banks were put under his thumb. Lending was based on cronyism. Development went forward at such a fevered pitch that two million people from other Arab countries and even Yugoslavia worked in Iraq to meet the growing demand for labor.\n\n\n=== Succession ===\nIn 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the strongman of the government. As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the de facto leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\nIn 1979, al-Bakr started to make treaties with Syria, also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President Hafez al-Assad would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.\n\n\n==== 1979 Ba'ath Party Purge ====\n\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979. During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped, Saddam claimed to have found a fifth column within the Ba'ath Party and directed Muhyi Abdel-Hussein to read out a confession and the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators. These members were labelled \"disloyal\" and were removed from the room one by one and taken into custody. After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty. The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of treason; 22 were sentenced to execution. Other high-ranking members of the party formed the firing squad. By 1 August 1979, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath party members had been executed.\n\n\n== Paramilitary and police organizations ==\n\nIraqi society fissures along lines of language, religion and ethnicity. The Ba'ath Party, secular by nature, adopted Pan-Arab ideologies which in turn were problematic for significant parts of the population. Following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iraq faced the prospect of r\u00e9gime change from two Shi'ite factions (Dawa and SCIRI) which aspired to model Iraq on its neighbour Iran as a Shia theocracy. A separate threat to Iraq came from parts of the ethnic Kurdish population of northern Iraq which opposed being part of an Iraqi state and favored independence (an ongoing ideology which had preceded Ba'ath Party rule). To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded certain benefits to the potentially hostile population. Membership in the Ba'ath Party remained open to all Iraqi citizens regardless of background, and repressive measures were taken against its opponents.\n\nThe major instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police organizations. Beginning in 1974, Taha Yassin Ramadan (himself a Kurdish Ba'athist), a close associate of Saddam, commanded the People's Army, which had responsibility for internal security. As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence was the most notorious arm of the state-security system, feared for its use of torture and assassination. Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Saddam's younger half-brother, commanded Mukhabarat. Foreign observers believed that from 1982 this department operated both at home and abroad in its mission to seek out and eliminate Saddam's perceived opponents.Saddam was notable for using terror against his own people. The Economist described Saddam as \"one of the last of the 20th century's great dictators, but not the least in terms of egotism, or cruelty, or morbid will to power.\" Saddam's regime brought about the deaths of at least 250,000 Iraqis and committed war crimes in Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International issued regular reports of widespread imprisonment and torture. Conversely, Saddam used Iraq's oil wealth to develop an extensive patronage system for the regime's supporters.Although Saddam is often described as a totalitarian leader, Joseph Sassoon notes that there are important differences between Saddam's repression and the totalitarianism practiced by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, particularly with regard to freedom of movement and freedom of religion.\n\n\n== Political and cultural image ==\n\nDuring his leadership, Saddam promoted the idea of dual nationalism which combines Iraqi nationalism and Arab nationalism, a much broader form of ethnic nationalism which supports Iraqi nationalism and links it to matters that impact Arabs as a whole. Saddam Hussein believed that the recognition of the ancient Mesopotamian origins and heritage of Iraqi Arabs was complementary to supporting Arab nationalism.\nIn the course of his reign, the Ba'athist regime officially included the historic Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin as a patriotic symbol in Iraq, while Saddam called himself son of the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar and had stamped the bricks of ancient Babylon with his name and titles next to him. \nAs a sign of his consolidation of power, Saddam's personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. \nSaddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: when visited villages, he appeared in the costumes of the Arabs, a thawb which the traditional clothes of the Arab peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood in his village), and even Kurdish clothing, but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor and hat, projecting the image of a powerful leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward Mecca. \nHe also conducted two show elections, in 1995 and 2002. In the 1995 referendum, conducted on 15 October, he reportedly received 99.96% of the votes in a 99.47% turnout, getting only 3,052 negative votes among an electorate of 8.4 million.In the 15 October 2002 referendum he officially achieved 100% of approval votes and 100% turnout, as the electoral commission reported the next day that every one of the 11,445,638 eligible voters cast a \"Yes\" vote for the president.He erected statues around the country, which Iraqis toppled after his fall.\n\n\n== Foreign affairs ==\n\nIraq's relations with the Arab world have been extremely varied. Relations between Iraq and Egypt violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's peace initiatives with Israel. In 1978, Baghdad hosted an Arab League summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the Camp David Accords. Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's \"natural role\" among Arab countries.\n\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated Rolex wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world. To his ally Kenneth Kaunda Saddam once sent a Boeing 747 full of presents\u2014rugs, televisions, ornaments.Saddam enjoyed a close relationship with Russian intelligence agent Yevgeny Primakov that dated back to the 1960s; Primakov may have helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991.Saddam visited only two Western countries. The first visit took place in December 1974, when the Caudillo of Spain, Francisco Franco, invited him to Madrid and he visited Granada, C\u00f3rdoba and Toledo. In September 1975 he met with Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in Paris, France.Several Iraqi leaders, Lebanese arms merchant Sarkis Soghanalian and others have claimed that Saddam financed Chirac's party. In 1991 Saddam threatened to expose those who had taken largesse from him: \"From Mr. Chirac to Mr. Chev\u00e8nement, politicians and economic leaders were in open competition to spend time with us and flatter us. We have now grasped the reality of the situation. If the trickery continues, we will be forced to unmask them, all of them, before the French public.\" France armed Saddam and it was Iraq's largest trade partner throughout Saddam's rule. Seized documents show how French officials and businessmen close to Chirac, including Charles Pasqua, his former interior minister, personally benefitted from the deals with Saddam.Because Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, Tariq Aziz, one of Saddam's aides, traveled abroad extensively and represented Iraq at many diplomatic meetings. In foreign affairs, Saddam sought to have Iraq play a leading role in the Middle East. Iraq signed an aid pact with the Soviet Union in 1972, and arms were sent along with several thousand advisers. The 1978 crackdown on Iraqi Communists and a shift of trade toward the West strained Iraqi relations with the Soviet Union; Iraq then took on a more Western orientation until the Gulf War in 1991.After the oil crisis of 1973, France had changed to a more pro-Arab policy and was accordingly rewarded by Saddam with closer ties. He made a state visit to France in 1975, cementing close ties with some French business and ruling political circles. In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel (1979).\nSaddam initiated Iraq's nuclear enrichment project in the 1980s, with French assistance. The first Iraqi nuclear reactor was named by the French \"Osirak.\" Osirak was destroyed on 7 June 1981 by an Israeli air strike (Operation Opera).\nNearly from its founding as a modern state in 1920, Iraq has had to deal with Kurdish separatists in the northern part of the country. Saddam did negotiate an agreement in 1970 with separatist Kurdish leaders, giving them autonomy, but the agreement broke down. The result was brutal fighting between the government and Kurdish groups and Iraqi bombing of Kurdish villages in Iran, which caused Iraqi relations with Iran to deteriorate. After Saddam negotiated the 1975 treaty with Iran, the Shah withdrew support for the Kurds, who were defeated.\n\n\n=== Iran\u2013Iraq War ===\n\nIn early 1979, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution, thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas\u2014hostile to his secular rule\u2014were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.\nThere had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of An Najaf. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. When Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. Here, Khomeini gained media connections and collaborated with a much larger Iranian community, to his advantage.\nAfter Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations.  In a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to the United Nations, he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.\n\nIraq invaded Iran, first attacking Mehrabad Airport of Tehran and then entering the oil-rich Iranian land of Khuzestan, which also has a sizable Arab minority, on 22 September 1980 and declared it a new province of Iraq. With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become \"the defender of the Arab world\" against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, Mikhail Gorbachev claimed that Leonid Brezhnev refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as \"an agent of the civilized world.\" The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored. Instead Iraq received economic and military support from its allies, who overlooked Saddam's use of chemical warfare against the Kurds and the Iranians, in addition to Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.In the first days of the war, there was heavy ground fighting around strategic ports as Iraq launched an attack on Khuzestan. After making some initial gains, Iraq's troops began to suffer losses from human wave attacks by Iran. By 1982, Iraq was on the defensive and looking for ways to end the war.\nAt this point, Saddam asked his ministers for candid advice. Health Minister Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim suggested that Saddam temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared to take in this opinion as part of his cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.\n\nDr. Ibrahim was arrested a few days after he started his new life as a sacked minister. He was known to have publicly declared before that arrest that he was \"glad that he got away alive.\" Pieces of Ibrahim's dismembered body were delivered to his wife the next day.Iraq quickly found itself bogged down in one of the longest and most destructive wars of attrition of the 20th century. During the war, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian forces fighting on the southern front and Kurdish separatists who were attempting to open up a northern front in Iraq with the help of Iran. These chemical weapons were developed by Iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by West German companies as well as using dual-use technology imported following the Reagan administration's lifting of export restrictions. The United States government also supplied Iraq with \"satellite photos showing Iranian deployments.\" In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime's record, although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Noel Koch later stated, \"No one had any doubts about [the Iraqis'] continued involvement in terrorism ... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.\" The Soviet Union, France, and China together accounted for over 90% of the value of Iraq's arms imports between 1980 and 1988.Saddam reached out to other Arab governments for cash and political support during the war, particularly after Iraq's oil industry severely suffered at the hands of the Iranian navy in the Persian Gulf. Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international community should force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions for a cease-fire. Despite several calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council, hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.\nOn 16 March 1988, the Kurdish town of Halabja was attacked with a mix of mustard gas and nerve agents, killing 5,000 civilians, and maiming, disfiguring, or seriously debilitating 10,000 more. (see Halabja massacre) The attack occurred in conjunction with the 1988 al-Anfal Campaign designed to reassert central control of the mostly Kurdish population of areas of northern Iraq and defeat the Kurdish peshmerga rebel forces. Claims by Saddam's government and its international supporters that Iran had actually gassed the Kurds at Halabja have been thoroughly debunked.The bloody eight-year war ended in a stalemate. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica states: \"Estimates of total casualties range from 1,000,000 to twice that number. The number killed on both sides was perhaps 500,000, with Iran suffering the greatest losses.\" Neither side had achieved what they had originally desired and the borders were left nearly unchanged. The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre-1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.\nSaddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. This backfired on Iraq and the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately re-sought cash, this time for postwar reconstruction.\n\n\n=== Al-Anfal Campaign ===\n\nThe Al-Anfal Campaign was a genocidal campaign against the Kurdish people (and many others) in Kurdish regions of Iraq led by the government of Saddam Hussein and headed by Ali Hassan al-Majid. The campaign takes its name from  Qur'anic chapter 8 (al-\u02beanf\u0101l), which was used as a code name by the former Iraqi Ba'athist administration for a series of attacks against the peshmerga rebels and the mostly Kurdish civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988. This campaign also targeted Shabaks and Yazidis, Assyrians, Turkoman people and Mandaeans and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed. Human Rights Watch estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 people were killed. Some Kurdish sources put the number higher, estimating that 182,000 Kurds were killed.\n\n\n=== Tensions with Kuwait ===\nThe end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait. Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30 billion, but they refused. Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, then led the opposition in OPEC to the cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off its huge debt.Saddam had consistently argued that Kuwait had historically been an integral part of Iraq, and had only come into being as a result of interference from the British government; echoing a belief that Iraqi nationalists had supported for the past fifty years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides. The extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2 million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; Saudi Arabia held another 25 percent. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq\u2013Kuwait border.As Iraq\u2013Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to the prospects of an invasion. For one, Washington had been taking measures to cultivate a constructive relationship with Iraq for roughly a decade. The Reagan administration gave Iraq roughly $4 billion in agricultural credits to bolster it against Iran. Saddam's Iraq became \"the third-largest recipient of U.S. assistance.\"Reacting to Western criticism in April 1990, Saddam threatened to destroy half of Israel with chemical weapons if it moved against Iraq. In May 1990 he criticized U.S. support for Israel warning that \"the United States cannot maintain such a policy while professing friendship towards the Arabs.\" In July 1990 he threatened force against Kuwait and the UAE saying \"The policies of some Arab rulers are American ... They are inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and security.\" The U.S. sent warplanes and combat ships to the Persian Gulf in response to these threats.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, met with Saddam in an emergency meeting on 25 July 1990, where the Iraqi leader attacked American policy with regards to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates:\n\nSo what can it mean when America says it will now protect its friends? It can only mean prejudice against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force. We know that you can harm us although we do not threaten you. But we too can harm you. Everyone can cause harm according to their ability and their size. We cannot come all the way to you in the United States, but individual Arabs may reach you. We do not place America among the enemies. We place it where we want our friends to be and we try to be friends. But repeated American statements last year made it apparent that America did not regard us as friends.\nGlaspie replied:\n\nI know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. ... Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south. Normally that would not be any of our business. But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the U.A.E. and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned.Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq \"would not accept death.\"U.S. officials attempted to maintain a conciliatory line with Iraq, indicating that while George H. W. Bush and James Baker did not want force used, they would not take any position on the Iraq\u2013Kuwait boundary dispute and did not want to become involved.Later, Iraq and Kuwait met for a final negotiation session, which failed. Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait. As tensions between Washington and Saddam began to escalate, the Soviet Union, under Mikhail Gorbachev, strengthened its military relationship with the Iraqi leader, providing him military advisers, arms and aid.\n\n\n== Gulf War ==\n\nOn 2 August 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, initially claiming assistance to \"Kuwaiti revolutionaries,\" thus sparking an international crisis. On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"Provisional Government of Free Kuwait\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th Governorate of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\"When later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said \"When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am.\" Saddam Hussein could pursue such military aggression with a \"military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France.\"Shortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new Mercedes 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two days before the first attacks, Saddam reportedly offered Egypt's Hosni Mubarak 50 million dollars in cash, \"ostensibly for grain.\"U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets. On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region. The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake. Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.Cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and Czechoslovakia, deployed a massive number of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.\nSaddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.During the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the Palestinian problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.\nSaddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a U.S.-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles, refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of U.S. and British armored and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the Euphrates.On 6 March 1991, Bush announced \"What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea\u2014a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.\"In the end, the Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and germ weapons and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.\n\n\n== 1990s ==\n\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed. Uprisings in 1991 led to the death of 100,000\u2013180,000 people, mostly civilians.The United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while Turkey opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.Saddam routinely cited his survival as \"proof\" that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito wrote, \"Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice.\" As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled anti-Western feelings.One U.S. Muslim observer noted: \"People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America ... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him.\" A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period \"from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.\"Saddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of Sharia law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is great\"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a \"Blood Qur'an,\" written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.The United Nations-placed sanctions against Iraq for invading Kuwait were not lifted, blocking Iraqi oil exports. During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions. On 9 December 1996, Saddam's government accepted the Oil-for-Food Programme that the UN had first offered in 1992.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iraq remained tense following the Gulf War. The U.S. launched a missile attack aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad 26 June 1993, citing evidence of repeated Iraqi violations of the \"no fly zones\" imposed after the Gulf War and for incursions into Kuwait. U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing weapons of mass destruction and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the \"Iraqi no-fly zones\" (Operation Desert Fox), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16\u201319 December 1998. After two years of intermittent activity, U.S. and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in February 2001. Former CIA case officer Robert Baer reports that he \"tried to assassinate\" Saddam in 1995, amid \"a decade-long effort to encourage a military coup in Iraq.\"Saddam continued involvement in politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including a meeting with the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: \"During your last visit here along with your colleagues we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening to what I was saying since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour.\" He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.\n\n\n== 2002 ==\nIn 2002, Austrian prosecutors investigated Saddam government's transactions with Fritz Edlinger that possibly violated Austrian money laundering and embargo regulations. Fritz Edlinger, president of the General Secretary of the Society for Austro-Arab relations (G\u00d6AB) and a former member of Socialist International's Middle East Committee, was an outspoken supporter of Saddam Hussein. In 2005, an Austrian journalist revealed that Fritz Edlinger's G\u00d6AB had received $100,000 from an Iraqi front company as well as donations from Austrian companies soliciting business in Iraq.In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the European Union was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's government for its \"systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.\" The resolution demanded that Iraq immediately put an end to its \"summary and arbitrary executions ... the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and involuntary disappearances.\"\n\n\n== 2003 invasion of Iraq ==\n\nMany members of the international community, especially the U.S., continued to view Saddam as a bellicose tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region. In his January 2002 state of the union address to Congress, President George W. Bush spoke of an \"axis of evil\" consisting of Iran, North Korea, and Iraq. Moreover, Bush announced that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, because of the threat of its weapons of mass destruction. Bush stated that \"The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade ... Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.\"After the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which demanded that Iraq give \"immediate, unconditional and active cooperation\" with UN and IAEA inspections, Saddam allowed U.N. weapons inspectors led by Hans Blix to return to Iraq. During the renewed inspections beginning in November 2002, Blix found no stockpiles of WMD and noted the \"proactive\" but not always \"immediate\" Iraqi cooperation as called for by Resolution 1441.With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein took part in an interview with CBS News reporter Dan Rather. Talking for more than three hours, he denied possessing any weapons of mass destruction, or any other weapons prohibited by UN guidelines. He also expressed a wish to have a live televised debate with George W. Bush, which was declined. It was his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade. CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in order to appear strong against Iran.The Iraqi government and military collapsed within three weeks of the beginning of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to U.S.-led forces on 9 April, marked symbolically by the toppling of his statue, Saddam was nowhere to be found.\n\n\n== Incarceration and trial ==\n\n\n=== Capture and incarceration ===\n\nIn April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war. Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war, but none was authenticated. At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting.\nSaddam was placed at the top of the \"U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis.\" In July 2003, his sons Uday and Qusay and 14-year-old grandson Mustapha were killed in a three-hour gunfight with U.S. forces.On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was captured by American forces after being found hiding in a hole in the ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. Documents obtained and released by the National Security Archive detail FBI interviews and conversations with Saddam while he was in U.S. custody. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer confirmed that Saddam Hussein had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.\nSaddam was shown with a full beard and hair longer than his familiar appearance. He was described by U.S. officials as being in good health. Bremer reported plans to put Saddam on trial, but claimed that the details of such a trial had not yet been determined. Iraqis and Americans who spoke with Saddam after his capture generally reported that he remained self-assured, describing himself as a \"firm, but just leader.\"British tabloid newspaper The Sun posted a picture of Saddam wearing white briefs on the front cover of a newspaper. Other photographs inside the paper show Saddam washing his trousers, shuffling, and sleeping. The United States government stated that it considered the release of the pictures a violation of the Geneva Convention, and that it would investigate the photographs. During this period Saddam was interrogated by FBI agent George Piro.The guards at the Baghdad detention facility called their prisoner \"Vic,\" which stands for 'Very Important Criminal', and let him plant a small garden near his cell. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former Iraqi leader that emerged during a March 2008 tour of the Baghdad prison and cell where Saddam slept, bathed, and kept a journal and wrote poetry in the final days before his execution; he was concerned to ensure his legacy and how the history would be told. The tour was conducted by U.S. Marine Maj. Gen. Doug Stone, overseer of detention operations for the U.S. military in Iraq at the time.\n\n\n=== Trial ===\n\nOn 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by U.S. forces at the U.S. base \"Camp Cropper,\" along with 11 other senior Ba'athist leaders, were handed over to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for crimes against humanity and other offences.\nA few weeks later, he was charged by the Iraqi Special Tribunal with crimes committed against residents of Dujail in 1982, following a failed assassination attempt against him. Specific charges included the murder of 148 people, torture of women and children and the illegal arrest of 399 others.\nAmong the many challenges of the trial were:\n\nSaddam and his lawyers contesting the court's authority and maintaining that he was still the President of Iraq.\nThe assassinations and attempted assassinations of several of Saddam's lawyers.\nThe replacement of the chief presiding judge midway through the trial.On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death by hanging. Saddam's half-brother, Barzan Ibrahim, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, head of Iraq's Revolutionary Court in 1982, were convicted of similar charges. The verdict and sentencing were both appealed, but subsequently affirmed by Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals.\n\n\n== Execution ==\n\nSaddam was hanged on the first day of Eid ul-Adha, 30 December 2006, despite his wish to be executed by firing squad (which he argued was the lawful military capital punishment, citing his military position as the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi military). The execution was carried out at Camp Justice, an Iraqi army base in Kadhimiya, a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad.\nSaudi Arabia condemned Iraqi authorities for carrying on with the execution on a holy day. A presenter from the Al-Ikhbariya television station officially stated: \"There is a feeling of surprise and disapproval that the verdict has been applied during the holy months and the first days of Eid al-Adha. Leaders of Islamic countries should show respect for this blessed occasion ... not demean it.\"Video of the execution was recorded on a mobile phone and his captors could be heard insulting Saddam. The video was leaked to electronic media and posted on the Internet within hours, becoming the subject of global controversy. It was later claimed by the head guard at the tomb where his remains lay that Saddam's body had been stabbed six times after the execution. Saddam's demeanor while being led to the gallows has been discussed by two witnesses, Iraqi Judge Munir Haddad and Iraqi national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie. The accounts of the two witnesses are contradictory as Haddad describes Saddam as being strong in his final moments whereas al-Rubaie says Saddam was clearly afraid.Saddam's last words during the execution, \"May God\u2019s blessings be upon Muhammad and his household. And may God hasten their appearance and curse their enemies.\" Then one of the crowd repeatedly said the name of the Iraqi Shiite cleric, Moqtada Al-Sadr. Saddam later said, \"Do you consider this manhood?\" The crowd shouted, \"go to Hell.\" Saddam replied, \"To the hell that is Iraq!?\"  Again, one of the crowd asked those who shouted to keep quiet for God. Saddam Hussein started recitation of final Muslim prayers, \"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" One of the crowd shouted, \"The tyrant [dictator] has collapsed!\" Saddam said, \"May God\u2019s blessings be upon Muhammad and his household (family)\". He recited the shahada one and a half times, as while he was about to say \u2018Muhammad\u2019 on the second shahada, the trapdoor opened, cutting him off mid-sentence. The rope broke his neck, killing him instantly.Not long before the execution, Saddam's lawyers released his last letter.A second unofficial video, apparently showing Saddam's body on a trolley, emerged several days later. It sparked speculation that the execution was carried out incorrectly as Saddam Hussein had a gaping hole in his neck.Saddam was buried at his birthplace of Al-Awja in Tikrit, Iraq, on 31 December 2006. He was buried 3 km (2 mi) from his sons Uday and Qusay Hussein. His tomb was reported to have been destroyed in March 2015. Before it was destroyed, a Sunni tribal group reportedly removed his body to a secret location, fearful of what might happen.\n\n\n== Marriage and family relationships ==\n\nSaddam married his first wife and cousin Sajida Talfah (or Tulfah/Tilfah) in 1963 in an arranged marriage. Sajida is the daughter of Khairallah Talfah, Saddam's uncle and mentor; the two were raised as brother and sister. Their marriage was arranged for Saddam at age five when Sajida was seven. They became engaged in Egypt during his exile, and married in Iraq after Saddam's 1963 return. The couple had five children.Uday Hussein (1964\u20132003), was Saddam's older son, who ran the Iraqi Football Association, Fedayeen Saddam, and several media corporations in Iraq including Iraqi TV and the newspaper Babel. Uday, while originally Saddam's favorite son and likely successor, eventually fell out of favor with his father due to his erratic behavior; he was responsible for many car crashes and rapes around Baghdad, constant feuds with other members of his family, and killing his father's favorite valet and food taster Kamel Hana Gegeo at a party in Egypt honoring Egyptian first lady Suzanne Mubarak. He became well known in the west for his involvement in looting Kuwait during the Gulf War, allegedly taking millions of dollars worth of gold, cars, and medical supplies (which were in short supply at the time) for himself and close supporters. He was widely known for his paranoia and his obsession with torturing people who disappointed him in any way, which included tardy girlfriends, friends who disagreed with him and, most notoriously, Iraqi athletes who performed poorly. He was briefly married to Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri's daughter, but later divorced her. The couple had no children.\nQusay Hussein (1966\u20132003), was Saddam's second\u2014and, after the mid-1990s, his favorite\u2014son. Qusay was believed to have been Saddam's later intended successor, as he was less erratic than his older brother and kept a low profile. He was second in command of the military (behind his father) and ran the elite Iraqi Republican Guard and the SSO. He was believed to have ordered the army to kill thousands of rebelling Marsh Arabs and was instrumental in suppressing Shi'ite rebellions in the mid-1990s. He was married once and had three children.\nRaghad Hussein (b. 1968) is Saddam's oldest daughter. After the war, Raghad fled to Amman, Jordan where she received sanctuary from the royal family. She is currently wanted by the Iraqi Government for allegedly financing and supporting the insurgency of the now banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party. The Jordanian royal family refused to hand her over. She was married to Hussein Kamel al-Majid and has had five children from this marriage.\nRana Hussein (b. 1969), is Saddam's second daughter. She, like her sister, fled to Jordan and has stood up for her father's rights. She was married to Saddam Kamel and has had four children from this marriage.\nHala Hussein (b. 1972), is Saddam's third and youngest daughter. Very little information is known about her. Her father arranged for her to marry General Kamal Mustafa Abdallah Sultan al-Tikriti in 1998. She fled with her children and sisters to Jordan. In June 2021, an Iraqi court ordered the release of her husband after 18 years in prison.\nSaddam married his second wife, Samira Shahbandar, in 1986. She was originally the wife of an Iraqi Airways executive, but later became the mistress of Saddam. Eventually, Saddam forced Samira's husband to divorce her so he could marry her. After the war, Samira fled to Beirut, Lebanon. She is believed to have been the mother of Saddam's sixth child. Members of Saddam's family have denied this.\nSaddam had allegedly married a third wife, Nidal al-Hamdani, the general manager of the Solar Energy Research Center in the Council of Scientific Research.\nWafa Mullah Huwaysh is rumored to have married Saddam as his fourth wife in 2002. There is no firm evidence for this marriage. Wafa is the daughter of Abd al-Tawab Mullah Huwaysh, a former minister of military industry in Iraq and Saddam's last deputy Prime Minister.In August 1995, Raghad and her husband Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Rana and her husband, Saddam Kamel al-Majid, defected to Jordan, taking their children with them. They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam would pardon them. Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.\nIn August 2003, Saddam's daughters Raghad and Rana received sanctuary in Amman, Jordan, where they are currently staying with their nine children. That month, they spoke with CNN and the Arab satellite station Al-Arabiya in Amman. When asked about her father, Raghad told CNN, \"He was a very good father, loving, has a big heart.\" Asked if she wanted to give a message to her father, she said: \"I love you and I miss you.\" Her sister Rana also remarked, \"He had so many feelings and he was very tender with all of us.\"With the intention of discrediting Saddam Hussein with his supporters, the CIA was considering in 2003 before the Iraq War to make a video in which he (Saddam) would be seen having sex with a male teenager.\n\n\n== Donations ==\n\n\n=== Detroit, Michigan ===\nIn 1979, Jacob Yasso of Sacred Heart Chaldean Church in Detroit congratulated Saddam Hussein on his presidency. In return, Yasso said that Saddam Hussein donated US$250,000 to his church, which is made up of at least 1,200 families of Middle Eastern descent. In 1980, Detroit Mayor Coleman Young allowed Yasso to present the key to the city of Detroit to Saddam Hussein. At the time, Saddam then asked Yasso, \"I heard there was a debt on your church. How much is it?\" After the inquiry, Saddam then donated another $200,000 to Chaldean Sacred Heart Church. Yasso said that Saddam made donations to Chaldean churches all over the world, and even went on record as saying \"He's very kind to Christians.\"\n\n\n== List of government and party positions held ==\nHead of Iraqi Intelligence Service (1963)\nVice President of the Republic of Iraq (1968\u20131979)\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq (1979\u20132003)\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Iraq (1979\u20131991 and 1994\u20132003)\nHead of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council (1979\u20132003)\nSecretary of the Regional Command (1979\u20132006)\nSecretary General of the National Command (1989\u20132006)\nAssistant Secretary of the Regional Command (1966\u20131979)\nAssistant Secretary General of the National Command (1979\u20131989)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBaghdad International Airport (formerly Saddam International Airport)\nHouse of Saddam\nIraqi biological weapons program\nLeadership analysis \u00a7 Saddam Hussein\nMontana Management\nOperation Rockingham\nOperation Babylon\nSaddam Beach, a fishing village in India named after Saddam Hussein, in an act of solidarity during the 1991 Gulf War\nSaddam Hussein (South Park) \u2013 A fictionalized version of Saddam in South Park\nSaddam Hussein Nagar, Sri Lanka\nSaddam Hussein's novels\nU.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAl-Ani, Dr. Abdul-Haq.

        "article": "Harry Norman Turtledove (born June 14, 1949) is an American author who is best known for his work in the genres of alternate history, historical fiction, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery fiction. He is a student of history and completed his Ph.D. in Byzantine history. His dissertation was on the period AD 565\u2013582. He lives in Southern California.\nIn addition to his birth name, Turtledove writes under a number of pen names: Eric Iverson, H. N. Turteltaub, Dan Chernenko, and Mark Gordian. He began publishing novels in the realm of fantasy starting in 1979 and continues to publish to the current day; his latest being  Or Even Eagle Flew (2021) about Amelia Earhart and WWII.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTurtledove was born in Los Angeles, California, on June 14, 1949 and grew up in Gardena in Southern California.  His paternal grandparents, who were Romanian Jews, had first emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, before they moved to California in the United States. He was educated in local public schools during his early life.\nAfter dropping out during his freshman year at Caltech, Turtledove attended UCLA, where he completed his undergraduate degree and received a Ph.D. in Byzantine history in 1977. His dissertation was The Immediate Successors of Justinian: A Study of the Persian Problem and of Continuity and Change in Internal Secular Affairs in the Later Roman Empire During the Reigns of Justin II and Tiberius II Constantine (AD 565\u2013582).\n\n\n== Career ==\nTurtledove published his first two novels, Wereblood and Werenight, in 1979 under the pseudonym \"Eric G. Iverson.\" He later explained that his editor at Belmont Tower did not think that people would believe the author's real name was \"Turtledove\" and came up with something more Nordic. He continued to use \"Iverson\" until 1985. Another early pseudonym was \"Mark Gordian.\"\nThat year, he published Herbig-Haro and And So to Bed under his real name. Turtledove has recently begun publishing historical novels under the pseudonym \"H. N. Turteltaub\" (Turteltaube means turtle dove in German). He published three books as \"Dan Chernenko\" (the Scepter of Mercy series).\nHe has written several works in collaboration, including The Two Georges with Richard Dreyfuss, \"Death in Vesunna\" with his first wife, Betty Turtledove (pen name: Elaine O'Byrne); Household Gods with Judith Tarr; and others with Susan Shwartz, S.M. Stirling, and Kevin R. Sandes.\nTurtledove won the Homer Award for Short Story in 1990 for \"Designated Hitter,\" the John Esten Cooke Award for Southern Fiction in 1993 for The Guns of the South, and the Hugo Award for Novella in 1994 for \"Down in the Bottomlands.\" Must and Shall was nominated for the 1996 Hugo Award and Nebula Award for Best Novelette and received an honorable mention for the 1995 Sidewise Award for Alternate History. The Two Georges also received an honorable mention for the 1995 Sidewise Award for Alternate History.\nHis Worldwar series received a Sidewise Award for Alternate History Honorable Mention in 1996. In 1998, his novel How Few Remain won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. He won his second Sidewise Award in 2003 for his novel Ruled Britannia. He won his third Sidewise Award for his short story \"Zigeuner\u201d and his fourth for his short story \"Christmas Truce.\"On August 1, 1998, Turtledove was named honorary Kentucky Colonel as guest of honor at Rivercon XXIII in Louisville, Kentucky. His The Gladiator was the cowinner of the 2008 Prometheus Award.\nTurtledove served as the toastmaster for Chicon 2000, the 58th World Science Fiction Convention.He is married to the mystery and science fiction writer Laura Frankos. His brother-in-law is the fantasy author Steven Frankos.\nPublishers Weekly dubbed Turtledove \"The Master of Alternate History.\" Within the genre, he is known for creating original alternate history scenarios, such as survival of the Byzantine Empire or an alien invasion during the middle of the Second World War. In addition, he has been credited with giving original treatment to alternate themes that had been dealt with by many others, such as the victory of the South in the American Civil War or the victory of Nazi Germany during the Second World War. His novels have been credited with bringing alternate history into the mainstream.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website, a complete bibliography of Turtledove's work, including a list of his various series.\nFantastic Fiction Author Page\nHarry Turtledove's page at Tor Books\nOfficial Turtledove YahooGroup\nHarry Turtledove page on the Internet Book List\nHarry Turtledove at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nNational Review Online audio interview with Harry Turtledove\nAn audio interview with Harry Turtledove (MP3 format) from Hour 25"

        "article": "Lyon Sprague de Camp (; November 27, 1907 \u2013 November 6, 2000) was an American writer of science fiction, fantasy and non-fiction. In a career spanning 60 years, he wrote over 100 books, including novels and works of non-fiction, including biographies of other fantasy authors. He was a major figure in science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDe Camp was born in New York City, one of three sons of Lyon de Camp, a businessman in real estate and lumber, and Emma Beatrice Sprague. His maternal grandfather was the accountant, banker, pioneering Volap\u00fckist and Civil War veteran Charles Ezra Sprague. De Camp once noted that he rarely used pen-names, \"partly because my own true name sounds more like a pseudonym than most pseudonyms do.\"De Camp began his education at the Trinity School in New York, then spent ten years attending the Snyder School in North Carolina, a military-style institution. His stay at the Snyder School was an attempt by his parents, who were heavy-handed disciplinarians, to cure him of intellectual arrogance and lack of discipline. He was awkward and thin, an ineffective fighter, and suffered from bullying by his classmates. His experiences at the school taught him to develop a detached, analytical style considered cold by all but his closest friends, though he could, like his father, be disarming and funny in social situations. He would later recall these challenging childhood experiences in the semi-autobiographical story Judgment Day (1955).An aeronautical engineer by profession, de Camp conducted his undergraduate studies at the California Institute of Technology (where his roommate was at one point noted rocket fuel scientist John Drury Clark), and earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Caltech in Aeronautical Engineering 1930. He earned his Master of Science degree in Engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology in 1933. De Camp was also a surveyor and an expert in patents.His first job was with the Inventors Foundation, Inc. in Hoboken, N.J., which was taken over by The International Correspondence Schools. De Camp transferred to the Scranton, PA division. He was Principal of the School of Inventing and Patenting when he resigned in 1937. His first book Inventions and Their Management resulted and was published in July 1937.\nOn August 12, 1939, de Camp married Catherine Crook, with whom he collaborated on science fiction and nonfiction beginning in the 1960s.\n\nDuring World War II, de Camp served as a researcher at the Philadelphia Naval Yard along with his fellow writers Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. De Camp eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy as a reserve officer.De Camp was a member of the all-male literary and dining club the \"Trap Door Spiders\" in New York City, which served as the basis of Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the \"Black Widowers.\"  De Camp himself was the model for the character named \"Geoffrey Avalon.\"De Camp was a founding member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loosely knit group of Heroic fantasy writers that was founded during the 1960s and led by Lin Carter, with entry by credentials as a fantasy writer alone.\nThe de Camps moved to Plano, Texas, in 1989, and Sprague de Camp died there on November 6, 2000, seven months after his wife, on what would have been her birthday, just three weeks before his own 93rd birthday. His ashes were inurned, together with hers, in the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\nDe Camp's personal library of about 1,200 books was acquired for auction by Half Price Books in 2005. The collection included books inscribed by fellow writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Carl Sagan, as well as de Camp himself.\n\n\n== Coinage of \"Extraterrestrial\" and \"E.T.\" ==\n\"Extraterrestrial\", a coinage from \"extra\" + \"terrestrial\", meaning from beyond earth, is attested as an adjective as early as 1868, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Its first use in connection with life beyond earth was likely by H. G. Wells, in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds. L. Sprague de Camp is credited with its first usage as a noun with the meaning of \"alien life\" and with coining the abbreviation \"E.T.\" in the first part of his two-part article \"Design for Life\", published in the May 1939 issue of Astounding Science Fiction.\n\n\n== Hypothesis regarding sea serpent sightings ==\nDe Camp made a suggestion in 1968 that fossil discoveries had influenced modern reports of sea monster sightings. The suggestion was made in his article \"Dinosaurs in Today's World\" in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction v. 34, no. 3, March 1968, later reprinted in his nonfiction collection The Fringe of the Unknown, Buffalo, New York: Prometheus, 1983. In 2019 de Camp's theory was scientifically tested by C. G. M. Paxton and D. Naish, who concluded trends in the data of reported sightings appear to support his hypothesis.\n\n\n== Body of work ==\nDe Camp was a materialist who wrote works examining society, history, technology and myth. He published numerous short stories, novels, non-fiction works and poems during his long career.De Camp had the mind of an educator, and a common theme in many of his works is a corrective impulse regarding similar previous works by other authors. A highly rational and logical thinker, he was frequently disturbed by what he regarded as logical lapses and absurdities in others' writings. Some, like Asimov, felt de Camp's conscientiousness about facts limited the scope of his stories: de Camp was reluctant to use technological or scientific concepts (e.g., hyperspace or faster-than-light travel) if he did not think them possible. Thus, his response to Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court was to write a similar time travel novel (Lest Darkness Fall) in which the method of time travel was rationalized and the hero's technical expertise both set at a believable level and constrained by the technological limitations of the age.In like fashion, he reimagined space opera and planetary romance in his \"Viagens Interplanetarias\" series, and the prehistoric precursor civilizations characteristic of much heroic fantasy in his Pusadian series. When he was not debunking literary conventions he was often explaining them. For example, in the Harold Shea stories co-written with his longtime friend Fletcher Pratt (1897\u20131956), the magical premises of some bodies of myths and legends were accepted but examined and elucidated in terms of their own systems of inherent logic. The imaginative civilizations in The Compleat Enchanter, for example, are built upon a cultural and technological reality based on scientific formulas. Characters may be transported to these different worlds, but the magic contained within those worlds is only feasible to the extent that it coincides with the technology of the day (e.g., the combustion engine). De Camp's explanatory tendency also carried over into his non-fictional writings, including advice to science fiction writers on handling the different states of languages in future worlds.\n\n\n=== Science fiction ===\nDe Camp's science fiction is marked by his interests in linguistics, ancient history, and the history and philosophy of science. His first published story was \"The Isolinguals\", in the September 1937 issue of Astounding Science Fiction\u2014the last issue edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, prior to the long tenure of John W. Campbell. Most of his early science fiction stories were unrelated to each other, the exceptions being his \"Johnny Black\" tales about a black bear uplifted to human-level intelligence, and his \"Drinkwhiskey Institute\" stories, a series of tall tales involving time travel. Campbell's fantasy magazine, Unknown, was suited to de Camp's idiosyncratic imagination, logic, and sense of humor. He contributed ten novels (five as collaborations), much of it characterized by humor and dry wit. De Camp eschewed the intention of being a satirist, insisting, instead, that the stories he wrote were meant less for instruction or improvement, as satire requires, and more for the amusement of his readers.De Camp's treatment of time travel and alternate history in stories such as Lest Darkness Fall (1939), \"The Wheels of If\" (1940), \"A Gun for Dinosaur\" (1956), \"Aristotle and the Gun\" (1958), and The Glory That Was (1960) challenged the popular notion of his time that history consisted of an arbitrary series of accidents. Instead, de Camp, through sound background knowledge and logical thought, systematically demonstrated how technological advances could determine the pattern of an eventful history. His display of technological determinism in historical recreation is considered a tour de force. Lest Darkness Fall, \"The Wheels of If\" and \"Aristotle and the Gun\" have been recognized as seminal works in the field of alternate history.His most extended work was his \"Viagens Interplanetarias\" series, set in a future where Brazil is the dominant power, particularly a sub-series of sword and planet novels set on the planet Krishna, beginning with The Queen of Zamba. His most influential Viagens novel was the non-Krishna work Rogue Queen, a tale of a hive society undermined by interstellar contact, which was one of the earliest science fiction novels to deal with sexual themes.\n\n\n=== Fantasy ===\n\nDe Camp was best known for his light fantasy, particularly two series written in collaboration with Pratt, the Harold Shea stories (from 1940 et seq.) and Gavagan's Bar (from 1950). Floyd C. Gale in 1961 said that they \"were far and away the finest team of fantasy collaborators\". De Camp and Pratt also wrote some stand-alone novels similar in tone to the Harold Shea stories, of which the most highly regarded is Land of Unreason (1942), and de Camp wrote a few more of this genre on his own.He was also known for his sword and sorcery, a fantasy genre revived partly by his editorial work on and continuation of Robert E. Howard's Conan cycle. He also edited a series of fantasy anthologies credited with helping to spark the renaissance of heroic fantasy in the late 1960s.De Camp also created three noteworthy sword and sorcery sequences. The Pusadian series (from 1951), composed of the novel The Tritonian Ring and several short stories, is set in an antediluvian era similar to Howard's.\nMore substantial is the Novarian series (from 1968), of which the core is the Reluctant King trilogy, beginning with The Goblin Tower, de Camp's most accomplished effort in the genre, continuing in The Clocks of Iraz, and concluding with The Unbeheaded King. The trilogy features the adventurer Jorian, ex-king of Xylar. Jorian's world is an alternate reality to which our own serves as an afterlife. Other novels in the sequence include The Fallible Fiend, a satire told from the point of view of a demon, and The Honorable Barbarian, a follow-up to the trilogy featuring Jorian's brother as the hero.\nThe Incorporated Knight series comprises some 1970s short stories by de Camp and two novels written in collaboration with Catherine Crook de Camp, The Incorporated Knight (1988) and The Pixilated Peeress (1991). The early short stories were incorporated into the first of these. The sequence is set in the medieval era of another alternate world sharing the geography of our own, but in which a Neapolitan empire filled the role of Rome and no universal religion like Christianity ever arose, leaving its nations split among competing pagan sects. The setting is borrowed in part from Mandeville's Travels.\n\n\n=== Historical fiction ===\nDe Camp also wrote historical fiction set in the era of classical antiquity from the height of the First Persian Empire to the waning of the Hellenistic period. Five novels published by Doubleday from 1958 to 1969 form a loosely connected series based on their common setting and occasional cross references. They were also linked by a common focus on the advancement of scientific knowledge, de Camp's chosen protagonists being explorers, artisans, engineers, innovators and practical philosophers rather than famous names from antiquity, who are relegated to secondary roles. The best known of his historical novels is The Dragon of the Ishtar Gate.\n\n\n=== Nonfiction ===\n\nDe Camp's first book was Inventions and Their Management, co-written with Alf K. Berle and published by International Textbook Company in 1937: a 733-page book with three-page list of law cases cited.He enjoyed debunking doubtful history and pseudoscientific claims about the supernatural. He conducted extensive research for what was to be a book on magic, witchcraft and occultism, though only the first chapter, \"The Unwritten Classics\" (March 1947), was published in the Saturday Review of Literature. By May 1976, concerned with what Paul Kurtz described as \"an enormous increase in public interest in psychic phenomena, the occult and pseudoscience,\" de Camp joined the newly formed Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal along with astronomers George Abell, Bart Bok, and Carl Sagan; philosophers Brand Blanshard, Antony Flew, Sidney Hook, and Ernest Nagel; authors Isaac Asimov, Daniel Cohen, Charles Fair, Martin Gardner, and Phillip J. Klass; psychologists Ray Hyman and B.F Skinner; and magician James Randi. Despite being a long-time writer of fantasy, de Camp did not believe in ghosts in the supernatural sense. His ghosts dwelt only in his mind as memories of his parents. His mother, he wrote in a New York Times Magazine article, died of an overdose of faith healing. When considering claims of UFO sightings, astrology, and other subjects considered moot by the scientific community, de Camp would address the circular logic expressed by enthusiasts by insisting on first-hand, unbiased, measurable data to back up the claims. \"In the history of cultism,\" de Camp said in a Science News interview, \"one is always experiencing a feeling of deja vu.\"He explained how ancient civilizations produced structures and architecture that many considered to be impossible for them, such as the Pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Works in this area include Lost Continents, Citadels of Mystery, and The Ancient Engineers.\nSome others of his many and wide-ranging nonfiction works were The Great Monkey Trial (about the Scopes Trial), The Ragged Edge of Science, Energy and Power, The Heroic Age of American Invention, The Day of the Dinosaur (which argued, among other things, that evolution took hold after Darwin because of the Victorian interest spurred by recently popularized dinosaur remains, corresponding to legends of dragons), Great Cities of the Ancient World and The Evolution of Naval Weapons (a United States government textbook).\nPublished in the July 1938 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, \"Language for Time Travelers\" won de Camp the first non-fiction readership monthly honor awarded in the magazine for his exploration of the communication difficulties for time travelers as pronunciation and semantics shift over time.De Camp's pioneering biographies of fantasy writers were many short articles and full-length studies of Robert E. Howard and H. P. Lovecraft, the first major independent biographies of both writers. Matthew Hartman, in a review of de Camp's Lovecraft: A Biography, stated that de Camp \"does not defend his subject; he criticizes where criticism is due, and he explains in historical and sociological context, rather than attempting to excuse.\" De Camp's \"warts and all\" approach to his subjects has been branded by some fans as unflattering and unbalanced. For instance, Mark Finn, author of Blood & Thunder: The Life & Art of Robert E. Howard, contends that de Camp deliberately framed his questions in regard to Howard to elicit answers matching his Freudian theories about him.De Camp also wrote nonfiction radio scripts for Voice of America.De Camp wrote a number of lesser-known but nonetheless significant works that explored such topics as racism, which he wrote could be more accurately described as ethnocentrism, noting that no scholar comparing the merits of various ethnicities has ever sought to prove that his own ethnicity was inferior to others. Isaac Asimov recalled de Camp finding the tendency of authors to portray human characters in outer-space science fiction as superior to aliens analogous to northern Europeans imagining they had some inherent superiority over other races.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nDe Camp and Willy Ley won the 1953 International Fantasy Award for nonfiction recognizing their study of geographical myths, Lands Beyond (Rinehart, 1952). De Camp was a guest of honor at the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention and was named the third Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy, after Tolkien and Fritz Leiber, at the 1976 convention. The Science Fiction Writers of America made him its fourth SFWA Grand Master in 1979 and he won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 1984, a Special Achievement Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 1996, citing \"seminal works in the field,\" and the Hugo Award for Nonfiction in 1997 for his autobiography, Time and Chance.At a meeting of the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) in Denver, Colorado, in April 2011, De Camp was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.  CSI was previously known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nL. Sprague de Camp has been depicted in fictional works by a number of other authors. Randall Garrett conflated him with J. R. R. Tolkien's Gandalf in the character of the magician \"Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray\" in his Lord Darcy series. He was the model for the \"Geoffrey Avalon\" character in Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the \"Black Widowers,\" and the unnamed court magician in Lawrence Watt-Evans' \"Return to Xanadu\" (The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp, 2005).\nHe also appears without fictional disguise in the short stories \"Green Fire\" by Eileen Gunn, Andy Duncan, Pat Murphy, and Michael Swanwick (Asimov's Science Fiction, April 2000) and \"Father Figures\" by Susan Shwartz (The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp, 2005), and in the novels In the Courts of the Crimson Kings (2008) by S. M. Stirling and The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown (2011) by Paul Malmont.\nA semi-fictionalized version of de Camp appears in the third episode of the 2017 TV series Manhunt: Unabomber, as one of several academics and authors consulted by the FBI on the basis of the citation of their work in the Unabomber manifesto. In the scene depicting this meeting, de Camp's name appears on a placard as \"L. Sprague de Camp, S.A.G.A. Author, The Ancient Engineers.\" De Camp's name does not specifically appear in the episode credits, which identify the roles of actors in the scene as composite characters. The Ancient Engineers is cited in endnote 18 of the manifesto.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nThis selection is limited to books.\n\n\n=== Science fiction ===\nLest Darkness Fall (1939) \u2013 an early alternate history novel that helped define the genre and remains in print after more than 70 years.\nThe Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction (1948) \u2013 early collection of de Camp's short fiction, including \"The Wheels of If\"\nGenus Homo (1950) (with P.

        "article": "Joaqu\u00edn Antonio Balaguer Ricardo (1 September 1906 \u2013 14 July 2002) was the President of the Dominican Republic who served three non-consecutive terms for that office from 1960 to 1962, 1966 to 1978, and 1986 to 1996.\nHis enigmatic, secretive personality was inherited from the Trujillo era, as well as his desire to perpetuate himself in power through dubious elections and state terrorism, and he was considered to be a caudillo. His regime of terror claimed 11,000 victims who were either tortured or forcibly disappeared and killed. Nevertheless, Balaguer was also considered to be instrumental in the liberalization of the Dominican government, and his time as leader of the Dominican Republic saw major changes such as legalized political activities, surprise army promotions and demotions, promoting health and education improvements and instituting modest land reforms.\n\n\n== Early life and introduction to politics ==\nBalaguer was born on 1 September 1906 in Navarrete, later named Villa Bison\u00f3 in the Santiago Province in the northwestern corner of the Dominican Republic. His father was Joaqu\u00edn Jes\u00fas Balaguer Lespier, a Puerto Rican native of Catalan and French ancestry, and his mother was Carmen Celia Ricardo Heureaux, daughter of Manuel de Jesus Ricardo and Rosa Amelia Heureaux (of French descent), who was also a half-cousin of President Ulises Heureaux. Balaguer was the only son in a family of several daughters.From a very early age, Balaguer felt an attraction to literature, composing verses that were published in local magazines even when he was very young.  After graduating from school, Balaguer earned a law degree from the University of Santo Domingo (UASD) and studied for a brief period at the University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne  As a youth, Balaguer wrote of the awe with which he was struck by his father's fellow countryman, the Harvard graduate and political leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu. Despite the profound differences regarding their ethical and world visions, Albizu\u2019s fiery and charismatic rhetoric captured Balaguer's imagination and his recollection of this occasion was a harbinger of his passion for politics and intellectual debate.Balaguer's political career began in 1930 (before Rafael Trujillo took control of the government) when he was appointed Attorney in the Court of Properties. In later years, he served as Secretary of the Dominican Legation in Madrid (1932\u20131935), Undersecretary of the Presidency (1936), Undersecretary of Foreign Relations (1937), Extraordinary Ambassador to Colombia and Ecuador (1940\u20131943 and 1943\u20131947), Ambassador to Mexico (1947\u20131949), Secretary of Education (1949\u20131955), and Secretary of State of Foreign Relations (1953\u20131956).\n\n\n== First presidency and its aftermath ==\nWhen Trujillo arranged to have his brother H\u00e9ctor re-elected to the presidency in 1957, he chose Balaguer as vice-president. Three years later, when pressure from the Organization of American States (OAS) convinced Rafael that it was inappropriate to have a member of his family as president, Trujillo forced his brother to resign, and Balaguer succeeded to the post.\n\nThe situation was dramatically altered, however, when Trujillo was assassinated in May 1961. Balaguer initially remained president, with the real power held by Trujillo's son, Ramfis. They initially took steps to liberalize the regime, granting some civil liberties and easing Trujillo's tight censorship of the press. Meanwhile, he revoked the nonaggression pact made with Cuba in January 1961. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a populace who had no memory of the instability and poverty that preceded Trujillo, and wanted more freedom and a more equitable distribution of wealth. At the same time, Ramfis' reforms went too far for the hard-line trujillistas led by his own uncles, H\u00e9ctor and Jos\u00e9 Arismendi Trujillo. As the OAS continued economic sanctions imposed for Trujillo's attempted murder of Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, Ramfis warned that the country could descend into civil war between left and right.Although official and unofficial repression of the opposition parties (the Dominican Revolutionary Party and National Civic Union, as well as the communist Dominican Popular Movement) continued, Balaguer publicly condemned this repression and in September he pledged to form a coalition government. Hector and Jose Trujillo left the country in October but the opposition parties demanded Ramfis withdraw from the government as well. At the end of October, Ramfis announced that he would resign if the OAS agreed to lift the economic sanctions. The OAS agreed on November 14 but Ramfis\u2019 uncles returned to the country the following day, hoping to lead a military coup. Ramfis resigned and went into exile on November 17 and rumours circulated that Air Force general Fernando Arturo S\u00e1nchez Otero would support pro-Castro revolutionaries. The United States now sent a small fleet of ships and 1,800 marines to patrol Dominican waters. The US consul informed Balaguer that these forces stood ready to intervene at his request, and would be supported by forces from Venezuela and Colombia. Air Force general Pedro Rafael Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Echavarr\u00eda announced his support for Balaguer and bombed pro-Trujillo forces. The Trujillo brothers again fled the country on November 20 and Echavarr\u00eda became Secretary of Armed Forces.The Union Civica Nacional (UCN) called a national strike and demanded the formation of a provisional government under their leader, Viriato Fiallo, with elections to be delayed until 1964. The military were vehemently against the UCN taking power and Echaverr\u00eda proposed a continuation of the Balaguer regime until the elections. The American consul mediated between the two sides and in January 1962 final agreement led to the creation of a seven-member Council of State, led by Balaguer but including members of the UCN, to replace both the Dominican Congress and the President and his cabinet until the election. The OAS finally lifted sanctions against the country upon the formation of the council. However, popular unrest against Balaguer continued and many saw Echaverr\u00eda as positioning himself to seize power. Military forces opened fire on demonstrators on 14 January which led to rioting the following day. On 16 January, Balaguer resigned and Echaverr\u00eda staged a military coup d'\u00e9tat and arrested the other member of the council. With the US supporting the UCN and a new national strike beginning immediately, Echaverr\u00eda was arrested by other officers two days later. The Council of State was restored under the leadership of Rafael Bonnelly and Balaguer went into exile in New York and Puerto Rico.Juan Bosch was elected president in 1962 in the country's first free election. He only held office from February 1963 until he was overthrown in a military coup seven months later. The country began a tumultuous period which by 24 April 1965 saw the start of the Dominican Civil War. Military officers had revolted against the provisional Junta to restore Bosch, whereupon U.S. President Lyndon Johnson, under the pretext of eliminating Communist influence in the Caribbean sent 42,000 U.S. troops to defeat the revolt in Operation Power Pack, on 28 April. The provisional government, headed by H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda-Godoy, announced general elections for 1966. Balaguer seized his chance, once he had the backing of the United States government, returning to the Dominican Republic with the purpose of destroying the popular groups that had participated in the rebellions of 1965. He formed the Reformist Party and entered the presidential race against Bosch, campaigning as a moderate conservative advocating gradual and orderly reforms. He quickly gained the support of the establishment and easily defeated Bosch, who ran a somewhat muted campaign out of fear of military retribution.\n\n\n== \"The Twelve Years\" (1966-1978) ==\n\nBalaguer found a nation severely beaten by decades of turbulence, with few short times of peace, and virtually ignorant of democracy and human rights. He sought to pacify the enmities surviving from the Trujillo regime and from the \n1965 civil war, but political murders continued to be frequent during his administration. He succeeded in partially rehabilitating the public finances, which were in a chaotic state, and pushed through a modest program of economic development.  He was easily reelected in 1970 against fragmented opposition and won again in 1974 after changing the voting rules in a way that led the opposition to boycott the race.\nDuring his years as president (known popularly in Dominican politics as simply \"the twelve years\"), Balaguer ordered the construction of schools, hospitals, dams, roads, and many important buildings. He also presided over steady economic growth, funded public housing, opened public schools, and expanded education during his term. Additionally, over 300 politicians became millionaires during his presidency.  However, his administration soon developed a distinct authoritarian cast, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. Political opponents were jailed and sometimes killed (by one estimate, 3,000 people with center-left leanings were murdered), and opposition newspapers were occasionally seized. Despite his authoritarian methods, Balaguer had far less power than Trujillo, and his rule was milder.\n\n\n== Defeat and return to power ==\nIn 1978 Balaguer sought another term.  However, by this time, inflation was on the rise, and the great majority of the people had gotten little benefit from the economic boom of the past decade.  Balaguer faced Antonio Guzm\u00e1n, a wealthy rancher running under the banner of the Dominican Revolutionary Party.  When election returns showed an unmistakable trend in Guzm\u00e1n's favor, the military stopped the count.  However, amid vigorous protests at home and strong pressure abroad, the count resumed.  When the returns were all in, Guzm\u00e1n handed Balaguer the first loss of his electoral career.  When Balaguer left office that year, it marked the first time in the Dominican Republic's history that an incumbent president peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.\nIn the 1982 elections, the PRD's Salvador Jorge Blanco defeated Balaguer, who had merged his party with the Social Christian Revolutionary Party to form the Social Christian Reformist Party two years earlier.\nBalaguer ran again in the 1986 elections, and took advantage of a split in the PRD and an unpopular austerity program to win the presidency again after an eight-year absence.  By this time, he was 80 years old and almost completely blind (he had lived with glaucoma for many years).\n\n\n== Third presidency ==\n\nBalaguer's third presidency was considerably more liberal than the \"Twelve Years\" had been. He was more tolerant of opposition parties and human rights.He undertook massive infrastructure projects, such as the construction of highways, bridges, schools, housing projects and hospitals. Following the style of Trujillo, these highly visible projects were much publicized over government-controlled media and through grandiose public ceremonies designed to enhance Balaguer's popularity. The projects were also used as a means to reward his political supporters with lucrative public works contracts.  The economy also improved considerably.\nBalaguer was narrowly reelected in the elections of 1990, defeating his old foe Juan Bosch by only 22,000 votes out of 1.9 million votes cast amid charges of fraud.\nFor the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' landing in the Americas and the visit of Pope John Paul II, Balaguer spent millions on a restoration of parts of historic, colonial Santo Domingo, and on sprucing up the parts of the city to be transversed by the pope, including the construction of a grand new avenue lined with modern housing blocks.\nMore controversial was that Balaguer spent two hundred million US dollars on the construction of a massive ten-story Columbus Lighthouse.  Completed in 1992, the Columbus Lighthouse was designed to beam the image of a Christian cross into the night sky and to be visible for tens of miles.  Since completion, the Columbus Lighthouse, which supposedly houses Columbus's remains, has been a minor tourist attraction.  Its light has almost never been used due to extremely high energy costs and frequent blackouts in the country. \nIn the 1994 elections, Balaguer decided to run again for the presidency, even though he was almost 90 years old and completely blind. This time, his most prominent opponent was Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez of the PRD.\nThe campaign was one of the nastiest in Dominican history.  Balaguer frequently played up Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez' Haitian ancestry to his advantage; Dominicans historically have a deep fear and mistrust of anyone with Haitian blood.  For example, Balaguer claimed that Pe\u00f1a would try to merge the country with Haiti if elected.  When the returns were announced, Balaguer was announced as the winner by only 30,000 votes.  However, many PRD supporters showed up to vote only to discover their names had vanished from the rolls.  Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez screamed fraud and called a general strike.  Demonstrations took place in support of the strike.\nAn investigation later revealed that the electoral board did not know the total number of registered voters, and the voting lists distributed at polling stations did not match those given to the parties. The investigation also revealed that about 200,000 people had been removed from the polls.  Amid such questions about the poll's legitimacy, Balaguer agreed to hold new elections in 1996\u2014in which he would not be a candidate.  It would be the first presidential election since 1966 in which Balaguer's name did not appear on the ballot.\nIn the 1996 elections, Balaguer's vice president, Jacinto Peynado, finished well short of making it to the runoff. Balaguer then threw his support to the Dominican Liberation Party's Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez in an unusual coalition with Bosch, his political foe of over 30 years.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nIn 2000, Balaguer sought the presidency yet again. Although by this time he could not walk without assistance, he nonetheless plunged into the campaign, well aware that his large reservoir of supporters could mean the difference in the election. He won around 23% of the votes in the election, with PLD candidate Danilo Medina just barely nosing him out for a spot in the runoff with PRD candidate Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda, who came just a few thousand votes short of outright victory.  Balaguer stated that he himself personally accepted Mej\u00eda's election, but hinted that his supporters would split their votes between Mej\u00eda and Medina in the runoff. Medina would have needed nearly all of Balaguer's supporters to cross over to him in order to have any realistic chance of overcoming a 25-point deficit in the first round. When it was apparent Medina would not get nearly enough support from Balaguer's voters to have a chance at victory, he pulled out of the runoff, handing the presidency to Mej\u00eda.On July 14, 2002, Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer died of heart failure at Santo Domingo's Abreu Clinic at the age of 95.\nHe was a polarizing figure who could incite as much hate as love from the population. Despite his image as a standard Latin American caudillo, Balaguer at the same time developed a legacy as a great reformer as well. His land reform policies were praised for successfully dishing out land to peasants and earned him support from the country's rural population.Ronald Reagan once said of him \"President Balaguer has been a driving force throughout his country's democratic development. In 1966 he led democracy's return to the Dominican Republic after years of political uncertainty and turmoil. Indeed, he is, in many ways, the father of Dominican democracy\" and Jimmy Carter complimented him saying \"President Balaguer has set an example for all leaders in this nation in changing his own country and his own people away from a former totalitarian government to one of increasingly pure democracy.\"\nA metro station in Santo Domingo is named after Balaguer.\nHe is one of the central characters in Mario Vargas Llosa's novel The Feast of the Goat.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBalaguer was a prolific author, who wrote many books for contemporary Dominican literature. His most famous work was his only narrative novel, called \"Los Carpinteros\". The most controversial of his works is perhaps \"Memorias de un Cortesano en la Era de Trujillo\", in which Balaguer, shielded by his political power admitted knowing the truth about the death of the revolutionary journalist Orlando Mart\u00ednez. Balaguer left a blank page in the middle of the book to be filled in at the time of his death.\nBalaguer explored several branches of literature. As a thorough researcher, he published many biographical books still used as reference, along with compilations and analysis of Dominican folk poets. As a poet, he was mostly of Post-Romantic influence, and his style remained strictly unchanged along his long career. Other themes, despite the sorrow expressed, are mostly noble: and idyllic view of nature, nostalgia, and memoirs of the past.\nHis total list of literary works is as follows:\n\nSalmos paganos (1922)\nClaro de luna (1922)\nTebaida l\u00edrica (1924)\nNociones de m\u00e9trica castellana (1930)\nAzul en los charcos (1941)\nLa realidad dominicana (1941)\nEl Tratado Trujillo\u2011Hull y la liberaci\u00f3n financiera de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana (1941)\nLa pol\u00edtica internacional de Trujillo (1941)\nGu\u00eda emocional de la ciudad rom\u00e1ntica (1944)\nLetras dominicanas (1944)\nHeredia, verbo de la libertad (1945)\nPalabras con acentos r\u00edtmicos (1946)\nRealidad dominicana.

        "article": "Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek (Czech: [\u02c8jaroslaf \u02c8\u0266a\u0283\u025bk]; 1883\u20131923) was a Czech writer, humorist, satirist, journalist, bohemian and anarchist. He is best known for his novel The Fate of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk during the World War, an unfinished collection of farcical incidents about a soldier in World War I and a satire on the ineptitude of authority figures. The novel has been translated into about 60 languages, making it the most translated novel in Czech literature.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJaroslav Ha\u0161ek's paternal ancestors were farmers rooted in Mydlovary in South Bohemia. Ha\u0161ek's grandfather from his father's side, Franti\u0161ek Ha\u0161ek, was a member of the Czech Landtag and later also the so-called Kromeriz convention. He was also involved in barricade fights in Prague in 1848. According to some rumors, he worked with Mikhail Bakunin during his stay in Bohemia in 1849. \n\nThe family of his mother, Katherine, n\u00e9e Jare\u0161ov\u00e1, was also from South Bohemia. His grandfather Anton\u00edn Jare\u0161 and his great-grandfather Mat\u011bj Jare\u0161 were pond-keepers of the Schwarzenberg princes in Kr\u010d village No. 32.His father, Josef Ha\u0161ek, a mathematics teacher and religious fanatic, died early of alcohol intoxication. He put an end to himself due to pain caused by cancer. Poverty then forced his mother Kate\u0159ina with three children to move more than fifteen times.\nAt the age of four, the doctor diagnosed a heart defect and \"stunted thyroid gland\" in little Jaroslav. Because of this, he spent a lot of time in the country, with his grandfather from his mother's side, in the so-called Ra\u017eice dam-house, especially with his younger brother Bohuslav. In his childhood, Jaroslav was jealous of Bohuslav and even tried several times to hurt him as a baby. Later they had an extremely strong relationship and traveled together a lot on foot. Bohuslav drank himself to death one year after Jaroslav's death.\nHa\u0161ek's childhood was ordinary, boyish, imbued with adventures with peers and reading Karl May and Jules Verne. However, this changed when Ha\u0161ek was eleven: the retired sailor N\u011bme\u010dek moved to Lipov\u00e1 Street, where the Ha\u0161eks lived at that time. N\u011bme\u010dek wrapped the teenage Ha\u0161ek around his little finger, pilfered the money that Ha\u0161ek had stolen at home, and began to lead him into bars, including the infamous Jedov\u00e1 ch\u00fd\u0161e (Poison Hut) on Apolin\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e1 Street, where he taught him to drink alcohol. In addition, he intentionally had sex with his girlfriend in front of the boy. It was a trauma for Ha\u0161ek. He later remembered these experiences with disgust and remorse. It probably influenced Ha\u0161ek's relationship with women. In his discussions with his comrades in the Russian legions, it is said that he said: \u201cCan there be anything worse in the world than such a human pig? I knew the devil, I didn't know anything about these things, and yet I felt such disgust and revulsion that it was enough to poison my whole life. I have also been afraid of the devil of the cross since then.\u201d\n Some theories about Ha\u0161ek's homosexuality, spread mainly by the literary historian Jind\u0159ich Chalupeck\u00fd (the essay \"Podivn\u00fd Ha\u0161ek\" in the book Expresionist\u00e9), have also originated here, as well as in the testimony of Ha\u0161ek's friend Rudolf \u0160imanovsk\u00fd.Shortly after Ha\u0161ek began his studies at the grammar school in Je\u010dn\u00e1 Street, his father died. In 1897 he was present at anti-German riots in Prague as a student. He was arrested and the gymnasium teachers forced him to \"voluntarily\" leave the institution. He then trained as a druggist in Koko\u0161ka's drugstore on the corner of Per\u0161t\u00fdn and Martinsk\u00e1 Street, but eventually graduated from the Czech-Slavonic Business Academy in Resslova Street. \n At the academy he made friends with Ladislav H\u00e1jek, and together they wrote and released a parody of the lyrical love poetry of May Shouts, in which Ha\u0161ek first laughed at pathos and entered the field of humorous literature.\nAfter graduation, he became an employee of Slavia Bank but soon began to earn his living exclusively in journalism and literature. At that time he also met Czech anarchists. He began to lead a bohemian and vagrant life. Together with his brother Bohuslav, he walked through, among other places, Slovakia and western Galicia (now in Poland). Stories from these trips were published by Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek in N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy.\nIn 1907 he became editor of the anarchist magazine Komuna and was briefly imprisoned for his work.\nIn the same year, he fell in love with Jarmila Mayerov\u00e1, but because of his bohemian life, her parents did not consider him a suitable partner for their daughter. When he was arrested for desecrating the Austro-Hungarian flag in Prague, Mayer's parents took her to the countryside in the hope that it would help end their relationship. In response, Ha\u0161ek tried to back out of his radical politics and get permanent work as a writer. In 1908 he edited the Women's Horizon. In 1909 he had sixty-four published short stories, and the same year he was appointed editor of Animal World magazine. Although this work did not last long (he was soon released for publishing articles on imaginary animals he had invented) yet he married Jarmila Mayerov\u00e1 on 23 May 1910. However, after a year of marriage, Jarmila returned to her parents after Ha\u0161ek was detained after trying to feign his own death. According to other sources, however, this was a serious attempt at suicide, motivated by the understanding that he was unable to live a marital life. After this attempt, he was briefly hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.\nFrom 1911 he contributed to the Czech Word, then to the Torch, Humorist Letters, Nettle, Cartoons, and for some time led the Institute of Cynology, which inspired his later book My Dog Shop.\nIn 1911 he founded The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law. He founded it with his friends in the Vinohrady pub called U zlat\u00e9ho litru (The Golden Liter) to parody the political life of that time. He also wrote the satirical work Political and Social History of the Party of Mild Progress within the limits of the law, but it was not published in book form until 1963.\nDuring this period, together with Franti\u0161ek Langer, Emil Artur Longen and Egon Erwin Kisch he co-authored a number of cabaret performances, where he was also the main performer.\nIn the summer of 1912 Ha\u0161ek spent several weeks in a pub in Chot\u011bbo\u0159, where he could not be gotten rid of and the proprietors waited in vain for payment. He described his stay in Chot\u011bbo\u0159 in the stories \"Traitor of the Nation in Chot\u011bbo\u0159\", the \"District Court in Malibor\", and \"How about the birthplace of Ign\u00e1t Herrmann or the Consecration in Krivice\".\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Ha\u0161ek lived with the cartoonist Josef Lada, who later illustrated the Good Soldier \u0160vejk.In February 1915 Ha\u0161ek was called up to the replacement battalion of 91st Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian army in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice. With the 12th march battalion of the regiment, he was in early July transported to the Eastern front in Galicia (now Ukraine). He served on the front until 24 September 1915 when he was captured by the Russians and sent to the Totskoye camp in Orenburg Governorate. Here he joined the Czechoslovak Legion in 1916. Then he was drafted into the 1st Regiment, where he worked as a scribe, emissary of the recruitment committee and gunner. Then he was transferred to the connecting section, machine-gun section (in which he participated in the Battle of Zborov against the Austrians) and the office of the 1st Regiment. From July 1916 to February 1918 he published in the journal \u010cechoslovan and Cs. soldier, and was the author of a number of anti-Bolshevik articles.\n\nAt the end of February 1918, he joined the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers' Party (forerunner of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, 1921\u20131992). What led Ha\u0161ek to abandon anarchism and to accept socialist ideals has nowhere been clarified. In March, the Czechoslovak legions embarked on their well-known retreat, with the aim of joining the Western Front via Vladivostok. Ha\u0161ek disagreed with this and went to Moscow, where he began to cooperate with the Bolsheviks. In April he transferred from the legions to the Red Army. He was sent to Samara and the following year he was director of the army printer in Ufa, chief of the department for work with foreigners, etc. At the end of 1918 he served as commander of the Chuvash troops in the Red Army and as deputy military commander of the Bugulma district. He then worked in Siberia, where he published several magazines. One of them was also the first magazine in the Buryat language, Jur (Dawn).\n\nIn 1920 he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Irkutsk, where he served as a member of the city soviet. In the same year he fell ill with typhoid fever, and in May he married a printing worker named Alexandra Grigorievna Lvov, called Shura, who took care of him after his illness. After his return to Czechoslovakia, he was not tried for polygamy because of the lack of order and recognition of various international treaties in Russia.\nIn December 1920 Ha\u0161ek returned to independent Czechoslovakia. He was initially placed in quarantine in Pardubice, and on 19 December he arrived in Prague with Shura. The Soviets had sent him to Czechoslovakia to organize the communist movement. However, he was prevented from doing so by two circumstances: on the one hand, in support of the Kladno riots, he received from the Russian authorities an amount of 1,500 marks, which, however, was completely devalued by German inflation. In addition, even before Ha\u0161ek's arrival in Prague, Jaroslav Handl\u00ed\u0159, leader of a clutch of Russian agents whom Ha\u0161ek was to contact, was arrested in Czechoslovakia. In this way Ha\u0161ek's interest in communist politics ended and he returned to his bohemian way of life. He visited pubs in Prague and its surroundings, where he wrote his stories. Many stories describing this period were written by Ha\u0161ek's friend Zden\u011bk Mat\u011bj Kud\u011bj.\nOn 25 August 1921 Ha\u0161ek left with his wife Shura and painter Jaroslav Panu\u0161ka for Lipnice nad S\u00e1zavou. By this time he was seriously ill and dangerously obese. In Lipnice he began writing his masterpiece, The Fate of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk during the World War. Eventually, he was unable to write, yet he continued to dictate \u0160vejk's chapters in his bedroom. On 3 January 1923 he died of heart paralysis. The last known photograph was taken in December 1922.\n\n\n== Contradictions and points of interest ==\nIn the Czech and Slovak public imagination Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek is fixed as a bohemian, perhaps even the prototypical bohemian of the early twentieth century. In fact, this is largely a legend and represents Ha\u0161ek's self-stylization. An internally disciplined author, Ha\u0161ek was very productive. From his works it is also apparent that he had an extensive (perhaps a little unsystematic) humanistic education.\nIt is most instructive to consider Ha\u0161ek's work in Russia during 1916 to 1920. He has never been and still is not perceived as a mere bohemian or humorist writer in Russia, but, on the contrary, as a very responsible Bolshevik army official and a respected intellectual. He was also a relatively skilled soldier. In 1918 he distinguished himself as a courageous commander of the Czechoslovak Red Army troops in the defense of Samara. Samara was at that time threatened from the direction of Lipyagi station by the Czechoslovak legions, which were fighting alongside the White troops to restore the imperial regime, although the legionnaires tried to maintain essential neutrality and fight against the Bolsheviks only when inevitable. On 8 June 1918, Samara was conquered by the legions. It is possible that at this time, Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek met with Czech \"brothers\" and may have encouraged them to leave the White-Russian party. After the fall of Samara, he was in hiding in a territory controlled by White troops (and Czechoslovak legions) for several months.It is possible that in specific revolutionary Russian conditions, Ha\u0161ek was given the opportunity to assert those aspects of his character that could not manifest themselves in stabilized and essentially small-town Czech conditions. It was also important that Ha\u0161ek was banned by his Party organization from drinking alcohol. He was basically sent to Czechoslovakia with the aim of organizing the communist movement, which also supports the thesis that he had to be perceived as a responsible person and a capable organizer in Soviet Russia.\nA subject of debate and speculation is how Ha\u0161ek behaved in the Red Army, especially at a time when he was a Commissioner \u2013 and deputy commander \u2013 of Bugulma.\nHa\u0161ek's close contact with and advocation for Lev Trotsky in Russia endangered Ha\u0161ek with the rise of Joseph Stalin. Ha\u0161ek's closest collaborators in Russia \u2013 Nikolai Ivanovich Kochkurov (\"Artem Vesely\") or Vladimir Yakovlevich Zazubrin \u2013 later became victims of Stalin's repression.There is also speculation about Ha\u0161ek's mysterious mission to Mongolia, which he probably undertook in Soviet service. The writer Pavel Gan claims that he was there in conjunction with the Chinese revolutionary Chen Chang-Hai, alias Vanya Chang, and was going to go with him to China, for which reason he probably learned solid Chinese.A not-well-known aspect of Ha\u0161ek's biography is that after returning to his homeland he found himself somewhat isolated. He was uncomfortable from left to right. After he left communist politics, for example, Stanislav Kostka Neumann described him as a \"traitor to the proletarian revolution\". For the poet Karel Toman he was branded a \"traitor of the nation\" by his red arm band and refused to shake his hand when he met him in a caf\u00e9 after the war. There were more such hostile reactions. Ha\u0161ek's departure to Lipnice, where he wrote \u0160vejk, was motivated by the hostile atmosphere he met in Prague.\n\n\n== Works ==\nInitially Ha\u0161ek wrote mainly travel stories, features and humoresques, which he published in magazines. He wrote most of his works in Prague pubs.His prose was based on his own real experiences, confusing investigation of his actual life, because it is not always clear what is true and what is only poetic hyperbole.\nHa\u0161ek hated pretense, sentimentality, settled life, to which he ironically reacted in satiric verse. Another characteristic feature of his work is resistance to moral and literary conventions.\nIn his life, he wrote about 1,200 short stories. Most of his short prose is scattered throughout various magazines and newspapers. Over the years nearly all the stories have been collected and printed in book's form. Some texts may however have been lost, for example, the story \"The History of the Ox.\" There is also a number of texts of which Ha\u0161ek's authorship is likely, but not confirmed.\nWords flowed easily from his pen, but this does not mean that he was not creative. Franti\u0161ek Langer stated that \"he was attracted, controlled, absorbed by writing, driven by his almost passionate passion for his writing.\"His most famous text by far, the four-part humorous novel The Fate of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk during the World War, has been translated into 58 languages and several times filmed and dramatized. Individual parts of the novel have the names: \u201cIn the Background (1921)\u201d, \u201cAt the Front (1922)\u201d, \u201cFamous Spanking (1922)\u201d and \u201cUnfinished Continuation of the Famous Spanking\u201d (1923). Ha\u0161ek's most important work is associated by many people with congenial illustrations by Josef Lada. Ha\u0161ek did not manage to complete the book. The completion of the work by Karel Van\u011bk is far from Ha\u0161ek's original conception. Vanek's completion was based on the continuation of 1921, but was highly criticized (Viktor Dyk, Jaroslav Durych, F. X. \u0160alda etc.). At first, the work had few followers. Ivan Olbracht was probably the first to mark it as a major work in the cultural section of Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo. \"It is one of the best books ever written in the Czech Republic, and Svejk is quite a new type in world literature, equivalent to Don Quixote, Hamlet, Faust, Oblomov, Karamazov,\" Olbracht wrote. Karel \u010capek, Josef \u010capek, Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk and V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, who connected Ha\u0161ek's work with Dadaism, also adopted a positive attitude, as did Dev\u011btsil theoretician Bed\u0159ich V\u00e1clavek. Discussions on the value of the work continued in later years. For example, V\u00e1clav \u010cern\u00fd opposed \u0160vejk, but a wide range of Czech literary theorists, artists, and intellectuals had other views \u2013 the philosopher Karel Kos\u00edk saw the novel as \"an expression of the absurdity of the alienated world\"; he described \u0160vejk as the \"tragic bard of European nihilism.\" The aesthetist Jan Grossman associated \u0160vejk with existentialism; the literary theorist Jind\u0159ich Chalupeck\u00fd described \u0160vejk as the \"tragic bard of European nihilism,\"; and the writer Milan Kundera described the novel as \"the pure irrationality of history.\".\u0160vejk has been dramatized several times, Ha\u0161ek himself performed the first dramatization for the Emil Artur Longen \"Revolutionary Scene\"; in 1928 \u0160vejk turned into a theater performance of Ha\u0161ek's friend Max Brod, in 1963 by Pavel Kohout. The international adaptation was achieved by the adaptation of Schweik in the Second World War by the German playwright and director Bertold Brecht.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVlastimil Ko\u0161vanec\nJosef Lada\nCecil Parrott\nStatue of Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPetri Liukkonen. \"Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek\".

        "article": "Norbert Zongo (31 July 1949 \u2013 13 December 1998), also known under the pen name of Henri Segbo or H.S., was a Burkinab\u00e9 investigative journalist who managed the newspaper L'Ind\u00e9pendant in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Under Zongo's supervision, L'Ind\u00e9pendant exposed extortion and impunity within the government of Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaor\u00e9. Zongo was assassinated after his newspaper began investigating the murder of a driver who had worked for the brother of Compaor\u00e9.\n\n\n== Personal history ==\nNorbert Zongo was born in the Koudougou region, French Upper Volta on 31 July 1949 into the Gnougnoossi family, a prominent subset of the Mossi people. While in secondary school in 1964, he created a newspaper, La Voix du Cours Normal, writing bulletins on his exercise sheets with information gleaned from morning broadcasts from Radio France Internationale, BBC World Service, and other international radio stations. School officials eventually banned his publication after it discussed political topics. After high school, Zongo pursued legal studies at University of Abidjan in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and journalism at the University of Benin in Togo. The latter university expelled him and he was imprisoned in Burkina Faso after Zongo published his political novel Le Parachutage. He was able to finish his education in journalism at the University of Yaound\u00e9 in Cameroon.Zongo was a supporter of human rights and also helped found the Movement for Human and Peoples' Rights, an organization in Burkina Faso.Norbert Zongo's remains are buried in Gounghin Military Cemetery located just east of Ouagadougou.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1971 Norbert Zongo began his career as a teacher in Ouagadougou, Kadiogo Province.Zongo was also a writer. His first novel Le Parachutage was a thinly disguised political critique of Togo's President Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema set in the post-colonial era. In the preface of the novel in 1988, Zongo mentions being arrested and beaten for writing it. He followed this novel with the colonial setting for Rougebeinga two years later, which was also political satire of leadership.In 1991, Zongo, after working for the national daily paper Sidwaya, founded La Clef with Saturnin Ki. It was the first newspaper in Burkina Faso to openly criticism the government, with Zongo contributing under the pseudonym Henri Sebgo (or H.S.). The paper folded in 1993. That June, Zongo founded the weekly L'Ind\u00e9pendant, which primarily covered government corruption. In 1996, he began investigating a series of fraud and graft cases involving several mining and manufacturing companies with ties to top political officials and President Blaise Compaor\u00e9's family. His resulting work severely embarrassed the government. The following year, Zongo directly criticized the Parliament's decision to amend the Constitution to allow Compaor\u00e9 to seek a third term.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nIn December 1997, a suspicious disappearance and possible murder of David Ouedraogo, who happened to be the driver of Fran\u00e7ois Compaor\u00e9 who was President Blaise Campaor\u00e9's brother, prompted Zongo to investigate. Ouedrago was tortured and killed for allegedly stealing large sums of money. Zongo reported the case and wrote small excerpts every week for his newspaper. He began getting death threats and the government ignored them. His wife, Genevieve Zongo, confirmed that he was receiving death threats from 1997 to his death in 1998. She was told that Norbert would often be followed by a car while on his motorbike. Zongo was also approached to convince him to drop his investigation, but he continued until his death.On December 13, 1998, four bodies were found shot and burned in a Toyota Land cruiser on the side of the road in Sapouy, Ziro Province. The remains were identified as Norbert Zongo; Zongo's brother Yembi Ernest Zongo; Blaise Ilboudo, a colleague; and Abdouleye Ablass\u00e9 Nikiema, who was Zongo's driver. Zongo's death triggered a national crisis and violent protests within Burkina Faso.In January 1999, Fran\u00e7ois Compaor\u00e9, President Blaise Compaor\u00e9's brother, was charged with murder and harboring the body of the victim in connection with the death of David Ouedraogo, his chauffeur, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after Fran\u00e7ois Compaor\u00e9 appealed against them.\nSix presidential body guards were identified as suspects in the murder. In August 2000, five members of the presidential security were charged for the murder of Ouedraogo. Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama and Ousseini Yaro, who are also suspects in the Norbert Zongo case, were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Edmond Koama died on January 4, 2001. Marcel Kafando was the only one who was charged for the crime, but the charges were later dropped on July 19, 2006. Marcel Kafando passed away three years later, in 2009. The judgment was called \"scandalous\" by Reporters Without Borders.\nIn 2013, the case was appealed for the family to have justice for their loss under a court system that was not under control of Burkina Faso. It was believed by the  African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights that Burkina Faso's government covered up the case and violated the revised treaty of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which allows freedom of expression and journalism. The ACHPR determined that the case should be reopened in order for the victim's families to be compensated for their losses.\n\n\n== Impact ==\n\nDuring his funeral, about 20,000 people walked 10 kilometers from the mortuary to the cemetery to pay tribute to him and solidarity with his cause. In 2006, Zongo's case was determined closed with no one found guilty, which enraged civil rights defenders and citizens of Burkino Faso.Norbert Zongo's widowed wife, Genevieve continued to keep his newspaper, the L'Ind\u00e9pendant, alive after his death. She remains the primary publisher and editor in memory of her late husband.In 2014, it was determined that Norbert Zongo's case was unfairly excused due to a bias in government.On the morning of October 29, 2017, Fran\u00e7ois Compaor\u00e9 was arrested at Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport, based on a May 2017 international arrest warrant.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists' Africa program coordinator, Sue Valentine, stated \"We praise Burkinabe authorities for taking this step (arresting three presidential soldiers involved in Zongo's murder) and call on them to ensure that the mastermind of this murder is identified and prosecuted. After 17 long years, the family, friends, and colleagues of Norbert Zongo deserve a thorough and transparent investigation leading to full justice.\"Reporters Without Borders' head of its Africa desk, Cl\u00e9a Kahn-Sriber, said, \"This ruling constitutes a major turning-point in the Zongo case, which has suffered appallingly from the impunity tolerated for all these years by Burkina Faso's justice system.\"Reporters Without Borders, who avidly campaigned for Zongo's case, stated, \"This has always been a highly political case. Zongo was killed by members of the presidential guard. Fran\u00e7ois Compaor\u00e9, the brother of President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, is implicated. The authorities never stopped protecting the killers. The president has got what he always wanted \u2013 injustice.\"The Independent Commission of Inquiry released the following statement: \"Norbert Zongo was assassinated for purely political motives because he practiced investigative journalism. He defended a democratic ideal and had chosen to become involved, with his newspaper, in the struggle for the respect of human rights and justice, and against the poor management of the public sector and impunity.\"\n\n\n== Legacy and commemoration ==\nMany Burkinab\u00e9 journalists accredit Zongo with being the first writer in the country to practice investigative journalism.\nThe singer Alpha Blondy wrote a song, Journalistes en danger, about the assassination of Zongo.\nIn 2012, a memorial was erected at the Highway N6 (Ouagadougou \u2013 L\u00e9o) near Sapouy, at the site of his murder.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2001 Zongo was posthumously given the Integrity Award for his work to expose government corruption.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLe Parachutage\nMovement for Human and Peoples' Rights\nEconomic Community of West African States\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights\nSue Valentine\nCl\u00e9a Kahn-Sriber\nChrysogone Zougmor\u00e9\nIntegrity Award\nJudge dismisses sole suspect in Zongo's Murder \u2013 IFEX\nAmnesty International: \"Burkina Faso: Amnesty International Welcomes Progress in the Norbert Zongo Case\"\nLe Monde (in French)"

        "article": "Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, 1st Marquis of Vargas Llosa (born 28 March 1936), more commonly known as Mario Vargas Llosa (, Spanish: [\u02c8ma\u027ejo \u02c8\u03b2a\u027e\u0263az \u02c8\u028eosa]), is a Peruvian novelist, journalist, essayist, and a former politician, who also holds Spanish citizenship. Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists, and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom. In 2010 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\" He also won the 1967 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit.\nVargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, literally The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and the monumental Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.\nLike many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now identifies as a liberal. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition, advocating classical liberal reforms, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. He is the person who, in 1990, \"coined the phrase that circled the globe,\" declaring on Mexican television, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship\", a statement which became an adage during the following decade.\nVargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\n\nMario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa. He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth. Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman; consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.Vargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died\u2014his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President Jos\u00e9 Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.When Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, La Industria, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, La huida del Inca.In 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odr\u00eda, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature. He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older. Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest in 1957 with the publication of his first short stories, \"The Leaders\" (\"Los jefes\") and \"The Grandfather\" (\"El abuelo\"), while working for two Peruvian newspapers. Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain. In 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there; however, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied. Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris where he began to write prolifically. Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964. A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, with whom he had three children: \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\n\n\n=== Beginning and first major works ===\nVargas Llosa's first novel, The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's Leoncio Prado Military Academy. This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success. Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics, and it won the Premio de la Cr\u00edtica Espa\u00f1ola award. Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a \"degenerate mind\" and stating that Vargas Llosa was \"paid by Ecuador\" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, The Green House (La casa verde), about a brothel called \"The Green House\" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church, and her transformation into la Selvatica, the best-known prostitute of \"The Green House\". The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative. The Green House won the first edition of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. This novel alone accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom. Some critics still consider The Green House to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement. Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that The Green House is \"one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America\".Vargas Llosa's third novel, Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur. A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as \"The Cathedral\". During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way. Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future. The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odr\u00eda by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives. The persistent theme of hopelessness makes Conversation in the Cathedral Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.He lectured on Spanish American Literature at King's College London from 1969 to 1970.\n\n\n=== 1970s and the \"discovery of humor\" ===\nIn 1971, Vargas Llosa published Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: Story of a Deicide (Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: historia de un deicidio), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid. Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in Mexico City at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, ending the friendship.  Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel. A photograph of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud. Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year. Historia de un Deicidio was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.\nFollowing the monumental work Conversation in the Cathedral, Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as \"the discovery of humor\". His first attempt at a satirical novel was Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (Pantale\u00f3n y las visitadoras), published in 1973. This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas. These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel The Green House, but in a different form. Captain Pantoja and the Special Service is, therefore, essentially a parody of both The Green House and the literary approach that novel represents. Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.From 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors. In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service. In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979. During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977\u201378.In 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La t\u00eda Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.\n\n\n=== Later novels ===\n\nVargas Llosa's fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark. Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.\nBecause of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.\nEven though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme. The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist. Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.After completing The War of the End of the World, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta (Historia de Mayta, 1984). The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja. Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay. The commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public. Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair. In 1986, he completed his next novel, Who Killed Palomino Molero (\u00bfQui\u00e9n mat\u00f3 a Palomino Molero?), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation. Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a \"literary exorcism\" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission. The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, Death in the Andes (Lituma en los Andes), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.It was almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: The Feast of the Goat (La fiesta del chivo), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since The War of the End of the World. Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as \"Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral\" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual. Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime. The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America, and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.In 1995, he wrote and published a children's book called Hitos y Mitos Literarios (\"The Milestones and the Stories of Greatest Literary Works\"), illustrated by Willi Glasauer. The book includes fun facts, trivia, and information accompanied by photos and Willi Glasauer's illustrations of the likes of Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Manhattan Transfer by John Dos Passos, The Stranger by Albert Camus, Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Death in Venice by Thomas Mann, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Herzog by Saul Bellow, East of Eden by John Steinbeck, Steppenwolf by Hermann Hesse, and A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway.\nIn 2003 he wrote The Way to Paradise in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.\nIn 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la ni\u00f1a mala), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.\nIn 2019 he published the novel Tiempos recios (Fierce times ), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Turn to liberalism ===\nLike many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.\nOver the course of the decade, Vargas Llosa became known as a \"neoliberal\", although he personally dislikes the term and considers it \"pure nonsense\" and only used for derision. According to then-Professor of Politics at New York University Timothy Mitchell, Vargas Llosa developed into \"an ex-leftist converted to neoliberalism by [Hernando] de Soto\", an economist that was promoted by neoliberal think tanks in the 1980s. Vargas Llosa later helped de Soto found the Institute for Liberty and Democracy and promote the neoliberal economist until the two grew distant in a dispute.With his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls \"the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career\". Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay. The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed \"how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left\". These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of \"paternalism\", while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iv\u00e1n Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world. Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre. US Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing \"indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity\". Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.\n\n\n=== Presidential candidacy ===\n\nIn 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad. The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the Partido Popular Cristiano), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as Frente Democr\u00e1tico (FREDEMO). He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States. He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property. Although he won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off. Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir A Fish in the Water (El pez en el agua, 1993). Since his political defeat, he has focused mainly on his writing, with only occasional political involvement.A month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, \"The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom\". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, \"I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety.\" He declared, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.\" The statement, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship\" became a clich\u00e9 in Mexico and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nVargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: \"I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling\". He then added: \"I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer\".Mario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992\u20131993 academic year. Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999. In 1994 he was elected a member of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat L on 15 January 1996. Vargas Llosa joined the neoliberal Mont Pelerin Society in 2014. He is also a member of Washington, D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.\n\n\n=== Political work ===\n\n\n==== Spain ====\nHe has been involved in the Spain's political arena. In February 2008 he stopped supporting the People's Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book Pol\u00edtica razonable, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa D\u00edez, \u00c1lvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Mart\u00ednez Gorriar\u00e1n. He continues to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He has also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.\n\n\n==== Peru ====\nIn April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001\u20132006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.Vargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: \"Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.\" In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.Since her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on far-right politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the authoritarian president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said \"the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history\". After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 \"Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections\". However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the \"lesser of two evils\".\n\n\n==== Chile ====\nDuring the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, the far-right candidate for president who defended the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\n\n\n=== Panama and Pandora Papers ===\nVargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid. Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made \"without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa\" while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Mart\u00edn, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer \"was not aware of the ownership of that company\". IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa's signature on a \"Consent to Act as Director\" form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.\n\n\n== Style of writing ==\n\n\n=== Plot, setting, and major themes ===\nVargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences. For example, in his first novel, The Time of the Hero, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold. Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written. Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality. For example, his two-volume novel Conversation in the Cathedral is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odr\u00eda. The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups. In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, The Green House, explores \"a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions\", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.Many of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic. His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru. The War of the End of the World was his first major work set outside Peru. Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902. The Feast of the Goat, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic; in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history. The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he \"respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated\", but at the same time he points out \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.\"One of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, The Way to Paradise (El para\u00edso en la otra esquina), is set largely in France and Tahiti. Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia. Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that The Way to Paradise lacks the \"audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius\" that was present in his previous works.\n\n\n=== Modernism and postmodernism ===\nThe works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude\u2014another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.\n\n\n=== Interlacing dialogues ===\n\nLiterary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches. This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, \u201cTiempos Recios,\u201d as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes Garc\u00eda, are juxtaposed.\n\n\n=== Literary influences ===\nVargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Mart\u00edn Ad\u00e1n, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and C\u00e9sar Moro. As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas. Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was \"an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities\". Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature. Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, La utop\u00eda arcaica (1996).\nRather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style. Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation. The epigraph of The Time of the Hero, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work. Flaubert's artistic independence\u2014his novels' disregard of reality and morals\u2014has always been admired by Vargas Llosa, who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's aesthetics, The Perpetual Orgy. In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that \"literature is an act of rebellion\", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs. Other critics such as Sabine K\u00f6llmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.One of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner. Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner \"the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel\". Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration. In The Time of the Hero, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, Light in August.In addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre. The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers; critic Sara Castro-Klar\u00e9n argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques. In The Perpetual Orgy, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of 2015, Vargas Llosa is in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and seeking a divorce from Patricia Llosa. He is an agnostic, \"I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic\".As for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes. The writer himself has confessed in his book A Fish in the Water since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old. In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nMario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Carlos Fuentes. In his book The New Novel in Latin America (La Nueva Novela), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature. Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was \"perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years\".Most of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success. Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers. He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life. During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.A number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including The Time of the Hero and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and The Feast of the Goat (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa). Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter was turned into the English-language film, Tune in Tomorrow. The Feast of the Goat has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Al\u00ed Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nVargas Llosa has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 Premio Leopoldo Alas and the 1962 Premio Biblioteca Breve to the 1993 Premio Planeta (for Death in the Andes) and the Jerusalem Prize in 1995. The literary critic Harold Bloom has included his novel The War of the End of the World in his list of essential literary works in the Western Canon.\nAn important distinction he has received is the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose \"work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language\". In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the PEN/Nabokov Award. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L.

        "article": "Lieutenant-General Mori Rintar\u014d (\u68ee \u6797\u592a\u90ce, February 17, 1862 \u2013 July 8, 1922), known by his pen name Mori \u014cgai (\u68ee \u9dd7\u5916), was a Japanese Army Surgeon general officer, translator, novelist, poet and father of famed author Mari Mori. He obtained his medical license at a very young age and introduced translated German language literary works to the Japanese public. Mori \u014cgai also was considered the first to successfully express the art of western poetry in Japanese. He wrote many works and created many writing styles. The Wild Geese (1911\u20131913) is considered his major work. After his death, he was considered one of the leading writers who modernized Japanese literature.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nMori was born as Mori Rintar\u014d (\u68ee \u6797\u592a\u90ce) in Tsuwano, Iwami Province (present-day Shimane Prefecture). His family were hereditary physicians to the daimy\u014d of the Tsuwano Domain. As the eldest son, it was assumed that he would carry on the family tradition; therefore he was sent to attend classes in the Confucian classics at the domain academy, and took private lessons in rangaku and Dutch.\nIn 1872, after the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the domains, the Mori family relocated to Tokyo. Mori stayed at the residence of Nishi Amane, in order to receive tutoring in German, which was the primary language for medical education at the time. In 1874, he was admitted to the government medical school (the predecessor for Tokyo Imperial University's Medical School), and graduated in 1881 at the age of 19, the youngest person ever to be awarded a medical license in Japan. It was also during this time that he developed an interest in literature, reading extensively from the late-Edo period popular novels, and taking lessons in Chinese poetry and literature.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nAfter graduation, Mori enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army as a medical officer, hoping to specialize in military medicine and hygiene. He was commissioned as a deputy surgeon (lieutenant) in 1882. Mori was sent by the Army to study in Germany (Leipzig, Dresden, Munich, and Berlin) from 1884 to 1888. During this time, he also developed an interest in European literature. As a matter of trivia, Mori \u014cgai is the first Japanese known to have ridden on the Orient Express. One of his major accomplishments was his ability to create works using a style of \"translation\" that he obtained from his experience in European culture.Upon his return to Japan, he was promoted to surgeon first class (captain) in May 1885; after graduating from the Army War College in 1888, he was promoted to senior surgeon, second class (lieutenant colonel) in October 1889. Now a high-ranking army doctor, he pushed for a more scientific approach to medical research, even publishing a medical journal out of his own funds. Meanwhile, he also attempted to revitalize modern Japanese literature and published his own literary journal (Shigarami s\u014dshi, 1889\u20131894) and his own book of poetry (Omokage, 1889). In his writings, he was an \"anti-realist\", asserting that literature should reflect the emotional and spiritual domain. The short story \"The Dancing Girl\" (\u821e\u59eb, Maihime, 1890) described an affair between a Japanese man and a German woman.He married two times. His first wife was Toshiko Akamatsu, a daughter of Admiral Noriyoshi Akamatsu and a close friend of Nishi Amane. The couple married in 1889 and had a son who was born in 1890, Oto, before divorcing later that same year. The divorce was under acrimonious circumstances that irreparably ended his friendship with Nishi. His second wife, whom he married in 1902, was Shigeko Arakawa. They had four children: Mari (1903-1987), Furitsu (1907-1908), who died in childhood, Annu (1909-1998), and Rui (1911-1991). Both daughters, Mari and Annu, as well his son Rui, became writers.\nIn May 1893, Mori was promoted to senior surgeon, first class (colonel).\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nAt the start of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894\u20131895, Mori was sent to Manchuria and, the following year, to Taiwan. In February 1899, he was appointed head of the Army Medical Corps with the rank of surgeon major-general and was based in Kokura, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. His transfer was because of his responses to fellow doctors and his criticism about their fields of research in the Japanese Medical Journal of which he was editor. In 1902, he was reassigned to Tokyo. He was attached to a division in the Russo-Japanese War, based out of Hiroshima.\nIn 1907, Mori was promoted to Surgeon General of the Army (lieutenant general), the highest post within the Japanese Army Medical Corps, and became head of the Imperial Fine Arts Academy, which is now the Japan Art Academy. Also in the same year, he also became chairman of the Beriberi Research Council in the Ministry of the Army and headed their first major research case. Mori \u014cgai discovered the cause of the beriberi disease and managed to create a foundation to build a remedy, but  the problem was only resolved after his death.He was appointed director of the Imperial Museum when he retired in 1916. Mori \u014cgai then died of renal failure and pulmonary tuberculosis six years later, aged 60.\n\n\n==== Literary work ====\n\nAlthough Mori did little writing from 1892 to 1902, he continued to edit a literary journal (Mezamashi gusa, 1892\u20131909). He also produced translations of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, and Hauptmann. It was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305) that Mori started keeping a poetic diary. After the war, he began holding tanka writing parties that included several noted poets such as Yosano Akiko. Mori \u014cgai helped found a new magazine called Subaru (literary magazine) in 1909 with the help of others such as Yosano Akiko and Yosano Tekkan. His later works can be divided into three separate periods. From 1909 to 1912, he wrote mostly fiction based on his own experiences. This period includes Vita Sexualis, and his most popular novel, Gan (\u96c1, The Wild Geese, 1911\u201313), which is set in 1881 Tokyo and was filmed by Shir\u014d Toyoda in 1953 as The Mistress.\nIn 1909, he released his novel Vita Sexualis which was abruptly banned a month later. Authorities deemed his work too sexual and dangerous to public morals. Mori \u014cgai, during the period he was writing Vita Sexualis, focused on making a statement regarding the current literary trends of modern Japanese literature. He approached the trend on sexuality and individualism by describing them as a link between body and soul. \u014cgai points out problems concerning the art and literature world in the 19th century in his work. His writing style, depicted from the Meiji government's perspective, derived from naturalism and was implemented with his thoughts that were brought up from writers who focused on the truth.His later works link his concerns with the Ministry of Education regarding the understanding of \"intellectual freedom\" and how they police and dictate the potential of literature. From 1912 to 1916, he wrote mostly historical stories. Deeply affected by the death of General Nogi Maresuke in 1912, he explored the impulses of self-destruction, self-sacrifice and patriotic sentiment. This period includes Sansh\u014d Day\u016b (\u5c71\u6912\u5927\u592b), and Takasebune (\u9ad8\u702c\u821f). From 1916 to 1921, he turned his attention to biographies of three Edo period doctors.To elaborate on one of \u014cgai\u2019s earlier works, Dancing Girl (\u821e\u59eb) was a story chronicling the love affair of a Japanese prodigy, Toyotar\u014d, with an uneducated German woman Elis. During this affair, Elis gets pregnant, and he leaves her to return to Japan. Toyotar\u014d spends much of his tale being torn between the life he leads in Germany with his new love, while being is pulled back to Japan by his job and family. He also spends a reasonable amount of time pondering his education, and the kind of a person it turned him into. His decision to leave her was instigated by his Japanese friend Aizawa, and the news drove Elis into madness, but despite this, Toyotar\u014d was grateful for his friend\u2019s meddling. Throughout the time that Dancing Girl was written, following the fall of the Tokugawa Period and the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, an isolationist mindset was a common theme amongst other authors (such as Natsume Soseki, Junichiro Tanizaki, etc.). The drastic culture shift influenced a lot of authors to focus their individuality and feelings of isolation into their works through their principle characters. In Dancing Girl in particular, the traditionalism of Tokugawa Japan and familial duty is pulling Toyotaro back, while the Meiji Japan that encouraged international knowledge and duty to that Japan is keeping him there.Sansho Dayu was an early Japanese work written in the mid 1600's, and Ogai's rewrite of it essentially changed some minor details and the ending, wherein which the bailiff's punishment is not given as much attention as in the original, and it is not so much violent as it is politically appropriate. There are also numerous supernatural elements removed from the original story, making it  palatable to a wider audience. Ogai's retelling of Sansho Dayu was made into a film, directed by Kenji Mizoguchi (1954). \n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nAs an author, Mori is considered one of the leading writers of the Meiji period. In his literary journals, he instituted modern literary criticism in Japan, based on the aesthetic theories of Karl von Hartmann. A house which Mori lived in is preserved in Kokurakita Ward in Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b, not far from Kokura Station. Here he wrote Kokura Nikki (\"Kokura Diary\"). His birthhouse is also preserved in Tsuwano. The two one-story houses are remarkably similar in size and in their traditional Japanese style. \nBecause of his biographical works, most notably Shibui Chusai (1916), Ogai is credited to be the pioneer of modern biographical literature in Japanese culture.His daughter Mari, who was nineteen years old at the time of his death, wrote extensively about her relationship with her father. Starting with her 1961 novella, A Lovers' Forest (\u604b\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u306e\u68ee, Koibito Tachi no Mori), she wrote tragic stories about love affairs between older men and boys in their late teens which influenced the creation of the Yaoi genre, stories about male-male relationships, written by women for women, that began to appear in the nineteen seventies in Japanese novels and comics. Mori's sister, Kimiko, married Koganei Yoshikiyo. Hoshi Shinichi was one of their grandsons.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\u014cgai Mori, along with many other historical figures from the Meiji Restoration is  a character in the historical fiction novel Saka no Ue no Kumo by Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba.  He also plays a significant part in the historical fantasy novel Teito Monogatari by Hiroshi Aramata.\nMori is a character in the manga and anime adaptation of Bungo Stray Dogs. Bungo Stray Dogs uses the names, stories and biographical details of authors to create its characters.\nAbe Ichizoku was referenced in the 2017 novel Killing Commendatore by Haruki Murakami.\nMori is a character in the anime Meiji Tokyo Renka.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nFrom the Japanese Wikipedia article\n\n\n=== Decorations ===\nOrder of the Golden Kite, 3rd Class (1 April 1906; Fourth Class: 20 September 1895)\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure (24 April 1915; Third Class: 29 November 1904; Fourth Class: 31 May 1900; Fifth Class: 25 November 1896; Sixth Class: 24 November 1894)\nGrand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (7 November 1915; Second Class: 1 April 1906; Sixth Class: 20 September 1895)\n\n\n=== Court ranks in the order of precedence ===\nSeventh rank (February 1882)\nSixth rank (28 December 1891)\nSenior sixth rank (16 December 1893)\nFifth rank (15 November 1895)\nSenior fifth rank (10 July 1899)\nFourth rank (13 September 1904)\nSenior fourth rank (20 October 1909)\nThird rank (10 November 1914)\nSenior third rank (10 May 1916)\nSecond rank (9 July 1922; posthumous)\n\n\n== Selected works ==\nMaihime (\u821e\u59eb, The Dancing Girl (1890))\nUtakata no ki (\u3046\u305f\u304b\u305f\u306e\u8a18, Foam on the Waves (1890))\nFumizukai (\u6587\u3065\u304b\u3072, The Courier (1891))\nWita sekusuarisu (\u30f0\u30bf\u30fb\u30bb\u30af\u30b9\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9, Vita Sexualis (1909))\nSeinen (\u9752\u5e74, Young Men (1910))\nGan (\u96c1, The Wild Geese (1911\u201313))\nOkitsu Yagoemon no isho (\u8208\u6d25\u5f25\u4e94\u53f3\u885b\u9580\u306e\u907a\u66f8, The Last Testament of Okitsu Yagoemon (1912))\nSansh\u014d Day\u016b (\u5c71\u6912\u5927\u592b, Sansh\u014d the Steward (1915))\nTakasebune (\u9ad8\u702c\u821f, The Boat on the Takase River (1916))\nShibue Ch\u016bsai (\u6e0b\u6c5f\u62bd\u658e, Shibue Chusai (1916))\nIzawa Ranken (\u4f0a\u6fa4\u862d\u8ed2, Izawa Ranken (1916\u201317))\nHojo Katei (\u5317\u6761\u971e\u4ead, Hojo Katei (1917\u201318))\n\n\n== Film adaptations ==\nThe Abe Clan (1938), directed by Hisatora Kumagai\nThe Wild Geese (1953), directed by Shir\u014d Toyoda\nSansho the Bailiff (1954), directed by Kenji Mizoguchi, is based on a short story by the author and is considered a milestone in Japanese movie history.\nThe Abe Clan (1995), directed by Kinji Fukasaku\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe Columbia Anthology of Modern Japanese Literature: From Restoration to Occupation, 1868\u20131945 (Modern Asian Literature Series) (vol. 1), ed.

        "article": "Adolfo Bioy Casares (Spanish pronunciation: [a\u02c8\u00f0olfo \u02c8\u03b2joj ka\u02c8sa\u027ees]; September 15, 1914 \u2013 March 8, 1999) was an Argentine fiction writer, journalist, diarist, and translator. He was a friend and frequent collaborator with his fellow countryman Jorge Luis Borges. He is the author of the Fantastique novel  The Invention of Morel.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAdolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914 in Buenos Aires, the only child of Adolfo Bioy Domecq and Marta Ignacia Casares Lynch. He was born in Recoleta, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires traditionally inhabited by upper-class families, where he would reside the majority of his life. Due to his family's high social class, he was able to dedicate himself exclusively to literature and, at the same time, distinguish his work from the traditional literary medium of his time. He wrote his first story (\"Iris y Margarita\") at the age of eleven. He began his secondary education in the Instituto Libre de Segunda Ense\u00f1anza at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. Later, he started but did not end up finishing degrees in law, philosophy, and literature. Fueled by disappointment with the university atmosphere, he moved to a family ranch where, when he didn't have visitors, he devoted himself almost entirely to his study of literature.  By the time he reached his late twenties, he maintained proficiency in Spanish, English, French (which he spoke from the age of 4) and German. Between 1929 and 1937 Bioy Casares published a number of books (Pr\u00f3logo, 17 disparos contra lo porvenir, Caos, La nueva tormenta, La estatua casera, Luis Greve, muerto) that he would later disdain, restricting additional publications and refusing to discuss them, labeling all his work previous to 1940 as 'horrible'.\nIn 1932 he met Jorge Luis Borges at Villa Ocampo, a house in San Isidro belonging to Victoria Ocampo. There, she often hosted different international figures and organized cultural celebrations, one of which brought Borges and Bioy Casares together. Bioy Casares recalled that on that particular occasion, the two writers stepped away from the rest of the guests, only to be reprimanded by Ocampo. This reproach provoked them to leave the gathering and return to the city together. The journey sealed a lifelong friendship and many influential literary collaborations. Under the pseudonyms H. Bustos Domecq and Benito Su\u00e1rez Lynch, the two teamed up on a variety of projects from short stories (Seis problemas para don Isidro Parodi, Dos fantas\u00edas memorables, Un modelo para la muerte), to screenplays  (Los orilleros, Invasi\u00f3n), and fantastic fiction (Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica, Cuentos breves y extraordinarios). Between 1945 and 1955, they directed \"El s\u00e9ptimo c\u00edrculo\" (\"The Seventh Circle\"), a collection of translations of popular English detective fiction, a genre that Borges greatly admired. In 2006, Borges, a biographical volume of more than 1600 pages from Bioy Casares' journals, revealed many additional details of the friendship shared by the two writers. Bioy Casares had already prepared and corrected the texts some time previously, but he never was able to publish them himself.\nIn 1940, he published the short novel The Invention of Morel, which marked the beginning of his literary maturity. The novel's introduction was written by Borges, in which he comments on the absence of precursors to science fiction in Spanish literature, presenting Bioy Casares as the pioneer of a new genre. The novella was very well accepted and received the Primer Premio Municipal de Literatura (First Municipal Prize of Literature) in 1941. During this same time, in collaboration with Borges and Silvina Ocampo, he published two anthologies: Antolog\u00eda de la literatura fant\u00e1stica (1940) y Antolog\u00eda po\u00e9tica argentina (1941).\nIn 1940, Bioy Casares married Silvina Ocampo, Victoria's sister, who was a painter as well as a writer. In 1954, one of Bioy Casares' mistresses gave birth in the United States to his daughter, Marta, who was subsequently adopted by his wife Silvina. Marta was killed in an automobile accident just three weeks after Silvina Ocampo's death, leaving Adolfo with two children. The estate of Silvina Ocampo and Adolfo Bioy Casares was awarded by a Buenos Aires court to yet another love child of Adolfo Bioy Casares, Fabi\u00e1n Bioy. Fabi\u00e1n Bioy died, aged 40, in Paris, France on 11 February 2006.\nBioy won several awards, including the Gran Premio de Honor of SADE (the Argentine Society of Writers, 1975), the French Legion of Honour (1981), the Diamond Konex Award of Literature (1994) the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires (1986), and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (awarded to him in 1991 in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares). Adolfo Bioy Casares is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe best-known novel by Bioy Casares is La invenci\u00f3n de Morel (The Invention of Morel). It is the story of a man who, evading justice, escapes to an island said to be infected with a mysterious fatal disease. Struggling to understand why everything seems to repeat, he realizes that all the people he sees there are actually recordings, made with a special machine, invented by Morel, which is able to record not only three-dimensional images, but also voices and scents, making it all indistinguishable from reality. The story mixes realism, fantasy, science fiction and terror. Borges wrote an introduction in which he called it a work of \"reasoned imagination\" and linked it to H. G. Wells' oeuvre. Both Borges and Octavio Paz described the novel as \"perfect\". The story is held to be the inspiration for Alan Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad and an influence on the TV series Lost.\nNovels and novellas\n\nLa nueva tormenta o la vida de Juan Ruteno, 167 pp. (1935; \"The New Storm or The Life of Juan Ruteno\")\nLa invenci\u00f3n de Morel, 126 pp. (1940; translated into English as The Invention of Morel, 1964, ISBN 1-59017-057-1)\nEl perjurio de la nieve, 64 pp. (1944; \"The Snow's Perjury\")\nPlan de evasi\u00f3n, 162 pp. (1945; translated into English as A Plan for Escape, 1975, ISBN 1-55597-107-5)\nEl sue\u00f1o de los h\u00e9roes, 216 pp. (1954; translated into English as The Dream of Heroes, 1987, ISBN 0-7043-2634-5)\nHomenaje a Francisco Almeyra, 37 pp. (1954; \"Homage to Francisco Almeyra\")\nDiario de la guerra del cerdo, 207 pp. (1969; translated into English as Diary of the War of the Pig, 1972, ISBN 0-07-073742-8)\nDormir al Sol, 229 pp. (1973; translated into English as Asleep in the Sun, 1978, ISBN 0-89255-030-9)\nLa aventura de un fot\u00f3grafo en La Plata, 223 pp. (1985; translated into English as The Adventures of a Photographer in La Plata, 1989, ISBN 0-7475-0798-8)\nUn campe\u00f3n desparejo, 110 pp. (1993; \"An Uneven Champion\")Short story collections\n\n17 disparos contra el porvenir, 173 pp. (1933; \"17 Shots Against the Future\")\nCaos, 283 pp. (1934, \"Chaos\")\nLuis Greve, muerto, 157 pp. (1937; \"Luis Greve, Deceased\")\nLa trama celeste, 246 pp. (1948; \"The Celestial Plot\")\nLas v\u00edsperas de Fausto, 15 pp. (1949; \"Faust's Eve\")\nHistoria prodigiosa, 151 pp. (1956; \"A Remarkable History\")\nEl lado de la sombra, 192 pp. (1962; \"The Shady Side\")\nEl gran seraf\u00edn, 190 pp. (1967; \"The Great Seraph\")\nEl h\u00e9roe de las mujeres, 191 pp. (1978; \"The Hero of Women\")\nHistorias desaforadas, 231 pp. (1986; \"Colossal Stories\")\nUna mu\u00f1eca rusa, 179 pp. (1991; translated into English as A Russian Doll and Other Stories, 1992, ISBN 0-8112-1211-4)Generally, these Spanish-language collections have not been systematically translated into English.

        "article": "Michael Austin Stackpole (born November 27, 1957)  is an American science fiction and fantasy author best known for his Star Wars and BattleTech books. He was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, but raised in Vermont. He has a BA in history from the University of Vermont. From 1977 on, he worked as a designer of role-playing games for various gaming companies, and wrote dozens of magazine articles with limited distribution within the industry. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\n\n== Game design career ==\nMichael Stackpole was hired full-time at Flying Buffalo after they accepted his submission for a solo Tunnels & Trolls adventure which was published in 1978 as City of Terrors.:\u200a36\u200a He wrote columns on industry news and reviews for Flying Buffalo's magazine Sorcerer's Apprentice.:\u200a36\u200a Stackpole worked for Coleco from 1980-1981 after Rick Loomis, Stackpole, and the president of Coleco met at a gaming and pinball convention.:\u200a36\u200a Stackpole designed the roleplaying game Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, which Flying Buffalo published in 1983.:\u200a38\u200a Stackpole left Flying Buffalo after the company's 1985 move to Scottsdale, Arizona.:\u200a39\u200a Stackpole, Ken St. Andre, and Liz Danforth designed the computer roleplaying game Wasteland, published by Interplay in 1988.:\u200a39\u200a He later returned to work with his fellow creators of Wasteland as a writer on its sequel Wasteland 2, released in 2014 by inXile Entertainment.In response to the accusations of Patricia Pulling (among others) who felt that the \"occult\" elements of Dungeons & Dragons were driving people to suicide, Stackpole began to defend the game and the roleplaying game community.:\u200a22\u200a Stackpole published one of his first articles about the role-playing games misinformation from the media in Sorcerer's Apprentice #14 (Spring 1982) as an article titled \"Devil Games? Nonsense!\",:\u200a38\u200a and even debated the Western Regional Director of Pulling's BADD organization on a radio program broadcast on July 14, 1987.:\u200a22\u200a He compared BADD's statistics of suicides among role-playing gamers to the rate of general teen suicide and found the percentage of roleplayers committing suicide was actually lower than those who were not gamers, and published his argument in an article called \"The Truth about Role-Playing Games\" in the 1989 book Satanism in America; he also published the document \"The Pulling Report\" in 1990, which further discredited Pulling's stand against roleplaying games.:\u200a22\u200aIn the 1980s, Stackpole began designing computer games for Coleco and then Interplay Productions.  His work at Interplay included Bard's Tale III, Wasteland, Neuromancer, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary and Star Trek: Judgment Rites.  He also created the role-playing game Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, which provided the game mechanics for Wasteland, and wrote several solo adventures for the Tunnels & Trolls role-playing system, including \"Dargon's Dungeon\", \"Overkill\", \"City of Terrors\" and \"Sewers of Oblivion\".\nStackpole loaned his image to Decipher for the image of Corran Horn used in their Star Wars Customizable Card Game expansion \"Reflections 2\".  Timothy Zahn did likewise for the character Talon Karrde. Stackpole teamed up with Decipher again, helping them write the background story to their WARS TCG, including e-books and other writing tie-ins for the expanded universe.\nIn January, 2019 Stackpole resigned from the Board of Directors of GAMA (Game Manufacturer's Association), citing its inactivity and the poor handling of an incident involving GAMA President Stephen Brissaud. He was one of the few remaining Emeritus Directors (alongside Rick Loomis and Will Niebling).\n\n\n== Writing career ==\n\nIn 1986 Stackpole wrote his first novel, the fantasy story Talion: Revenant.  His editors believed that a 175,000 word book was too long for an unknown author and that the story wasn't particularly engaging. The story remained unpublished for the next 11 years until reworked by Stackpole's editor, Anne Lesley Groell. Stackpole clarifies these issues himself in the afterword of the published version of Talion. The manuscript was published in 1997 by Bantam Books.\nStackpole's first published novels were the Warrior trilogy for the BattleTech universe, published by FASA in 1988-1989.:\u200a122\u200a His \"Blood of Kerensky\" trilogy (1989-1991) were the last novels that FASA directly published; BattleTech: The Animated Series (1994) was set during the events of this trilogy.:\u200a124\u200a Stackpole also wrote a trilogy of novels published in 1992, which were based on the Dark Conspiracy roleplaying game by GDW.:\u200a60\u200aStackpole has found his greatest success in serial works that continue the characters and plot lines developed by other authors.  In 1987 he began writing novels set in the BattleTech universe for FASA Corporation, some of which were used as the source for a television animated series. He was then selected to write several novels in the Star Wars universe for Bantam Books. He also wrote several comics based in the Star Wars universe for Dark Horse Comics. Initially these covered the period just before his X-Wing novels. Later, he also covered the marriage of Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade in the graphic novel Union and collaborated with Timothy Zahn on Mara Jade's early career. In the foreword to his book Outbound Flight, Timothy Zahn thanks Stackpole and issues a challenge at Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.\nIn addition, he has written several novels and short stories with original settings. One series is the DragonCrown War Cycle. These books attempted to break fantasy conventions in order to stir reader interest, including the introduction of firearms in a fantasy setting.  Reception of these books was fairly positive based on Amazon reviews, but reviews elsewhere were not as good.Stackpole contributed one of the four stories in Roger Zelazny's shared world anthology Forever After, published by Baen Books in 1995. He was a contributor in the 1998 anthology Lord of the Fantastic commemorating Zelazny.\nThe Age of Discovery trilogy is his latest complete series, with A New World released mid-2007. The trilogy is set in a fantasy world, with an attempt at an unconventional approach to magic and mastery.\nThe Crown Colonies is a trilogy that re-imagines the events of the American Revolutionary War. The first book, At The Queen's Command, was released in November 2010.\nAt New York Comic Con 2012, it was revealed that Blizzard Entertainment had approached Stackpole to write the next novel in their series based on the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft. The novel, titled Vol\u2019jin: Shadows of the Horde, centres around the chieftain of the Darkspear Trolls as his loyalty to the Horde is put to the ultimate test after an assassination attempt on his life. The novel was released in July 2013.\n\n\n== The Secrets ==\n\n\n=== Newsletter ===\nStackpole also writes and publishes an online newsletter titled The Secrets, which offers tips, tricks, and tidbits about  fiction writing (focusing on, but not limited to, science fiction and fantasy). It is aimed towards the serious fan fiction writer and some casual writers, and includes information about getting books published..\nTopics discussed in the newsletter range from how to beat writer's block to how to build a world, and even how to manage writing as a career.\nThe Secrets newsletter requires a subscription, and issues are released every two weeks.\n\n\n=== Podcast ===\nThe Secrets Newsletter has an \"audio companion\" in The Secrets Podcast. The first ten podcasts were based on material from the first ten issues of The Secrets newsletter. After the first series ended, the content of the podcast diverged from the newsletter. The podcasts average twenty-five minutes long and are voiced and produced by Stackpole.\nThe podcasts are free and require no subscription, but older episodes have been retired and are no longer available on the main archive.\nStackpole is also one of the main hosts on The Dragon Page Cover to Cover, a book review and interview show dealing mainly with fantasy and sci fi publications, together with Michael R. Mennenga.\n\n\n== Skepticism ==\nStackpole has been the executive director of the Phoenix Skeptics since 1988 and is listed as the contact for the group in the magazine Skeptical Inquirer.\n\n\n== Asteroid ==\nAn outer main-belt asteroid discovered March 23, 2001 by David B. Healy was named 165612 Stackpole.\n\n\n== Novels ==\n\n\n=== DragonCrown War ===\nPublished by Bantam Books.\n\n2000 The Dark Glory War\n2001 Fortress Draconis\n2002 When Dragons Rage\n2003 The Grand Crusade\n\n\n=== Age of Discovery ===\nPublished by Bantam Books.\n\n2005 A Secret Atlas\n2006 Cartomancy\n2007 The New World\n\n\n=== The Crown Colonies ===\nPublished by Night Shade Books.\n\n2010 At The Queen's Command.\n2011 Of Limited Loyalty. \n\n\n=== Homeland Security Services ===\n2011 Perfectly Invisible (Stormwolf.com)\n\n\n=== World of Warcraft ===\n2013 Vol'jin: Shadows of the Horde\n\n\n=== BattleTech ===\nThe BattleTech novels were originally published by FASA Corporation up until 1991. In that year, Penguin Group/Roc Books took over the line and also reprinted the earlier novels. The last print novel of the classic BattleTech setting was published in 2002; in the same year, the first novel for the Dark Age setting (set some 100 years after the classic setting) was published, written by Stackpole. His novels were typically \"spine novels\" that moved the setting ahead, narrating large-scale or otherwise important events with far-reaching consequences in the fictional timeline.\n\nWarrior Trilogy1988 Warrior: En Garde  (FASA, ROC reprint)\n1988 Warrior: Riposte  (FASA, ROC reprint)\n1989 Warrior: Coup\u00e9  (FASA, ROC reprint)Blood of Kerensky Trilogy1989 Lethal Heritage  (FASA, ROC reprint)\n1990 Blood Legacy  (FASA, ROC reprint)\n1991 Lost Destiny  (FASA, ROC reprint)Other BattleTech Spine Novels1992 Natural Selection (novel)  (ROC)\n1993 Assumption of Risk (ROC)\n1994 Bred For War  (ROC)\n1996 Malicious Intent  (ROC)\n1997 Grave Covenant  (ROC) - Twilight of the Clans series #2\n1998 Prince of Havoc (ROC) - Twilight of the Clans series #7Mechwarrior - Dark Age setting2002 Ghost War (ROC/WizKids)\n2007 Masters of War (ROC/WizKids)\n\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n1996 X-Wing: Rogue Squadron  (Bantam Books)\n1996 X-Wing: Wedge's Gamble  (Bantam Books)\n1996 X-Wing: The Krytos Trap (Bantam Books)\n1997 X-Wing: The Bacta War  (Bantam Books)\n1998 I, Jedi (Bantam Books)\n1999 X-Wing: Isard's Revenge (Bantam Books)\n2000 The New Jedi Order - Dark Tide I: Onslaught (Del Rey Books)\n2000 The New Jedi Order - Dark Tide II: Ruin (Del Rey Books)\n\n\n=== Dark Conspiracy ===\nPublished by GDW.\n\n1991 A Gathering Evil\n1991 Evil Ascending\n1992 Evil Triumphant\n\n\n=== Others ===\n1994 Once a Hero  (Bantam Books)\n1994 Dementia  (Roc/Target)\n1997 Talion: Revenant  (Bantam Books)\n1997 A Hero Born  (HarperPrism)\n1998 An Enemy Reborn (HarperPrism)\n1998 Wolf and Raven (Roc/FASA)\n1998 Eyes of Silver (Bantam Books)\n2010 In Hero Years I'm Dead (Stormwolf.com)\n2011 Conan the Barbarian (Berkley Books)\n2014 The Crusader Road (Paizo Publishing)\n\n\n== Other publications ==\n1989 Game Hysteria and the Truth\n1990 The Pulling Report\n1991  (with co author Loren K.

        "article": "Eduardo Hughes Galeano (Spanish pronunciation: [e\u02c8\u00f0wa\u027e\u00f0o \u0263ale\u02c8ano]; 3 September 1940 \u2013 13 April 2015) was a Uruguayan journalist, writer and novelist considered, among other things, \"global soccer's pre-eminent man of letters\" and \"a literary giant of the Latin American left\".Galeano's best-known works are Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Open Veins of Latin America, 1971) and Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire Trilogy, 1982\u20136). \"I'm a writer,\" the author once said of himself, \"obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia.\"Author Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called Open Veins of Latin America \"a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.\"\n\n\n== Life ==\nEduardo Germ\u00e1n Mar\u00eda Hughes Galeano was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 3 September 1940. His two family names were inherited from Welsh and Italian (from Genoa) great-grandfathers; the other two were from Germany and Spain. Galeano wrote under his maternal family name; as young man, he briefly wrote for a Uruguayan socialist publication, El Sol, signing articles as \"Gius,\" \"a pseudonym approximating the pronunciation in Spanish of his paternal surname Hughes.\"  Galeano's family belonged to the fallen Uruguayan aristocracy. \nAfter completing two years of secondary school, Galeano went to work at age fourteen  in various jobs, including messenger and fare collector. He eventually landed at El Sol. The Uruguayan socialist weekly first published the teenager's comics prior to his writing.  Galeano's passion for drawing continued throughout his life; his vignettes can be seen in many of his later books while his signature was often accompanied by a small hand-drawn pig. As a journalist throughout the 1960s Galeano rose in prominence among leftist publications, and became editor of Marcha, an influential weekly with contributors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Mario Benedetti, Manuel Maldonado Denis and Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar. For two years he edited the daily \u00c9poca and worked as editor-in-chief of the University Press. In 1959 he married his first wife, Silvia Brando, and in 1962, having divorced, he remarried to Graciela Berro.In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay; Galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee, going into exile in Argentina where he founded the magazine Crisis.  His 1971 book Open Veins of Latin America was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina. In 1976 he married for the third time to Helena Villagra; however, in the same year, the Videla regime took power in Argentina in a bloody military coup and his name was added to the list of those condemned by the death squads. He fled again, this time to Spain, where he wrote his famous trilogy, Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire), described as \"the most powerful literary indictment of colonialism in the Americas.\"\n\nAt the beginning of 1985 Galeano returned to Montevideo when democratization occurred. Following the victory of Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and the Broad Front alliance in the 2004 Uruguayan elections marking the first left-wing government in Uruguayan history Galeano wrote a piece for The Progressive titled \"Where the People Voted Against Fear\" in which Galeano showed support for the new government and concluded that the Uruguayan populace used \"common sense\" and were \"tired of being cheated\" by the traditional Colorado and Blanco parties. Following the creation of TeleSUR, a Latin American television station based in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2005 Galeano along with other left-wing intellectuals such as Tariq Ali and Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel joined the network's 36 member advisory committee.On February 10, 2007, Galeano underwent a successful operation to treat lung cancer. During an interview with journalist Amy Goodman following Barack Obama's election as President of the United States in November 2008, Galeano said: \"The White House will be Barack Obama's house in the time coming, but this White House was built by black slaves. And I'd like, I hope, that he never, never forgets this.\" At the 17 April 2009 opening session of the 5th Summit of the Americas held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave a Spanish-language copy of Galeano's Open Veins of Latin America to U.S. President Barack Obama, who was making his first diplomatic visit to the region.In a May 2009 interview he spoke about his past and recent works, some of which deal with the relationships between freedom and slavery, and democracies and dictatorships: \"not only the United States, also some European countries, have spread military dictatorships all over the world. And they feel as if they are able to teach democracy\". He also talked about how and why he has changed his writing style, and his recent rise in popularity.\nIn April 2014 Galeano gave an interview at the II Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura in which he regretted some aspects of the writing style in Las Venas Abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina, saying \"Time has passed, I've begun to try other things, to bring myself closer to human reality in general and to political economy specifically. 'The Open Veins' tried to be a political economy book, but I simply didn't have the necessary education. I do not regret writing it, but it is a stage that I have since passed.\" This interview was picked up by many critics of Galeano's work in which they used the statement to reinforce their own criticisms. However, in an interview with Jorge Majfud he said, \"The book, written ages ago, is still alive and kicking.  I am simply honest enough to admit that at this point in my life the old writing style seems rather stodgy, and that it's hard for me to recognize myself in it since I now prefer to be increasingly brief and untrammeled. [The] voices that have been raised against me and against The Open Veins of Latin America are seriously ill with bad faith.\"\n\n\n== Works ==\n\"Fleas dream of buying themselves a dog, and nobodies dream of escaping poverty: that, one magical day, good luck will suddenly rain down on them \u2013 will rain down in buckets. But good luck doesn\u2019t rain down, yesterday, today, tomorrow or ever. Good luck doesn\u2019t even fall in a fine drizzle, no matter how hard the nobodies summon it, even if their left hand is tickling, or if they begin the new day on their right foot, or start the new year with a change of brooms. The nobodies: nobody\u2019s children, owners of nothing. The nobodies: the no-ones, the nobodied, running like rabbits, dying through life, screwed every which way. Who are not, but could be. Who don\u2019t speak languages, but dialects. Who don\u2019t have religions, but superstitions. Who don\u2019t create art, but handicrafts. Who don\u2019t have culture, but folklore. Who are not human beings, but human resources. Who do not have faces, but arms. Who do not have names, but numbers. Who do not appear in the history of the world, but in the crime reports of the local paper. The nobodies, who are not worth the bullet that kills them.\"\n\"The noose\". New Left Review. II (17). September\u2013October 2002.\n\"Nothingland\u2014or Venezuela?\". New Left Review. II (29). September\u2013October 2004.Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Open Veins of Latin America), a history of the region from the time of Columbus from the perspective of the subjugated people, is considered one of Galeano's best-known works. An English-language translation by Cedric Belfrage gained some popularity in the English-speaking world after Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave it as a gift to U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009.Galeano was also an avid fan of football, writing most notably about it in Football in Sun and Shadow (El f\u00fatbol a sol y sombra). In a retrospective for SB Nation after Galeano's death, football writer Andi Thomas described the work\u2014a history of the sport, as well as an outlet for the author's own experiences with the sport and his political polemics\u2014as \"one of the greatest books about football ever written\".\n\n\n== Death ==\nGaleano died on 13 April 2015 in Montevideo from lung cancer at the age of 74, survived by third wife Helena Villagra and three children.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n2006: International Human Rights Award by Global Exchange\n2010: Stig Dagerman Prize\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Uruguay\nList of Uruguayan writers\nZ Communications\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterview with Eduardo Galeano\nSandra Cisneros reads \"Los Nadies/The Nobodies\" by Eduardo Galeano from Book of Embraces, El libro de los abrazos (1989)  \"[1]\".\n\"Writer Without Borders\"\u2014interview by Scott Widmer on In These Times\n\"Author of the Month,\" Escritores.org\n\"Ch\u00e1vez creates overnight bestseller with book gift to Obama\", The Guardian, 19 April 2009\nEduardo Galeano Interviewed by Jonah Raskin by Monthly Review, October 2009\nHaiti Occupied Country\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nEduardo Galeano at Find a Grave\n\"Eduardo Galeano, Chronicler of Latin America\u2019s 'Open Veins,' on His New Book 'Children of the Days'\" (interview), Democracy Now!, 8 May 2013"

        "article": "Mario Orlando Hardy Hamlet Brenno Benedetti Farrugia (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8ma\u027ejo \u03b2ene\u02c8\u00f0eti] (listen); 14 September 1920 \u2013 17 May 2009), was a Uruguayan journalist, novelist, and poet and an integral member of the Generaci\u00f3n del 45. Despite publishing more than 80 books and being published in twenty languages he was not well known in the English-speaking world. In the Spanish-speaking world he is considered one of Latin America's most important writers of the latter half of the 20th century.Benedetti was born in Paso de los Toros in the department of  Tacuaremb\u00f3 to Brenno Benedetti (a pharmaceutical and chemical winemaker) and Matilde Farrugia (a family of Italian descent). Two years later, they moved to Tacuaremb\u00f3, the capital city of the province, and shortly after that, his father tried to buy a chemist\u2019s but was swindled and went into bankruptcy, so, they moved and settled in Montevideo, the capital city of the country, where they lived in difficult economic conditions. Mario completed six years of primary school at the Deutsche Schule in Montevideo, where he also learned German, which later allowed him to be the first translator of Kafka in Uruguay. His father immediately removed him from the school when Nazi ideology started featuring in the classroom. For two years afterwards he studied at Liceo Miranda, but for the rest of his high school years he did not attend an educational institution. In those years he learned shorthand, which was his livelihood for a long time. At age 14 he began working, first as a stenographer and then as a seller, public officer, accountant, journalist, broadcaster and translator. He trained as a journalist with Carlos Quijano, in the weekly Marcha. Between 1938 and 1941 he lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He worked in different professions on both banks of the R\u00edo de la Plata river, for example, as a stenographer. In 1946 he married Luz L\u00f3pez Alegre.\nHe was a member of the 'Generation of 45', a Uruguayan intellectual and literary movement which included Carlos Maggi, Manuel Flores Mora, \u00c1ngel Rama, Emir Rodr\u00edguez Monegal, Idea Vilari\u00f1o, Carlos Real de Az\u00faa, Jos\u00e9 Pedro D\u00edaz, Amanda Berenguer,  Ida Vitale, L\u00edber Falco, Juan Carlos Onetti, among others.He also wrote for the famous weekly Uruguayan newspaper Marcha from 1945 until it was forcibly closed by the military government in 1973, and was its literary director from 1954. In 1957 he traveled to Europe and visited nine countries as a correspondent for Marcha weekly magazine and El Diario newspaper.\n\n\n== Exile ==\nFor 12 years, from 1973 to 1985, when a civic-military dictatorship ruled Uruguay, Benedetti lived in exile. He first went to Buenos Aires, and then to Lima in Peru where he was detained, deported and then given amnesty. He went to Cuba in 1976 and the following year to Madrid, Spain. His exile was made particularly trying by the fact that his wife had to remain in Uruguay to look after both of their mothers. In 1980 he moved to Palma, Majorca.\n\n\n== Return to Uruguay ==\n\nBenedetti returned to Uruguay in March 1985 following the restoration of democracy, and thereafter divided his time between Montevideo and Madrid.  He has been granted Honoris Causa doctorates by the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Uruguay, the Universidad de Alicante, Spain and the Universidad de Valladolid, Spain. In 1986 he was awarded Laureate Of The International Botev Prize. On 7 June 2005, he was named the recipient of the Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo International Prize. His poetry was also used in the 1992 Argentine movie The Dark Side of the Heart (El lado oscuro del coraz\u00f3n) in which he read some of his poems in German.In 2006, Mario Benedetti signed a petition in support of the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.\n\n\n== Illness and death ==\nIn the last ten years of his life he suffered from asthma and spent his winters in Madrid (where it was summer) in order to avoid the cold, though as his health deteriorated he eventually remained in Montevideo. In 2006 his wife Luz L\u00f3pez died, ending more than six decades of matrimony.\nHe died in Montevideo on 17 May 2009. He had suffered from respiratory and intestinal problems for more than a year. His remains are buried at the National Pantheon in the Central Cemetery of Montevideo.Before dying he dictated to his personal secretary, Ariel Silva, what would become his last poem:\n\n\n== Work ==\nFor his poetry and novels Benedetti won numerous international awards. La Tregua, first published in 1960, has since been translated into over 20 languages (into English by Harry Morales) and inspired the 1974 film The Truce.

        "article": "Miroslav Krle\u017ea (pronounced [m\u01d0r\u0254\u031dslav\u031e k\u0159\u0329le\u031e\u0292a]; 7 July 1893 \u2013 29 December 1981) was a Yugoslav and Croatian writer who is widely considered to be the greatest Croatian writer of the 20th century. He wrote notable works in all the literary genres, including poetry (Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh, 1936), theater (Messrs. Glembay, 1929), short stories (Croatian God Mars, 1922), novels (The Return of Philip Latinowicz, 1932; On the Edge of Reason, 1938), and an intimate diary. His recurrent theme is bourgeois hypocrisy and conformism in Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Krle\u017ea wrote numerous essays on problems of art, history, politics, literature, philosophy, and military strategy, and was known as one of the great polemicists of the century. His style combines visionary poetic language and sarcasm.Krle\u017ea dominated the cultural life of Croatia and Yugoslavia for half a century. A \"Communist of his own making\", he had been severely criticized in Communist circles in the 1930s for his refusal to submit to the tenets of socialist realism. After the Second World War, he held various cultural posts in Socialist Yugoslavia, and was most notably the editor of the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute and a constant advisor on cultural affairs to President Tito. After the break with Stalin, it was his speech at the 1952 Congress of Yugoslav Writers that signaled a new era of comparative freedom in Yugoslav literature.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMiroslav Krle\u017ea was born in Zagreb. He enrolled in a preparatory military school in P\u00e9cs, modern-day Hungary. At that time, P\u00e9cs and Zagreb were within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Subsequently, he attended the Ludoviceum military academy at Budapest. He defected to Serbia but was dismissed as a suspected spy. Upon his return to Croatia, he was demoted in the Austro-Hungarian army and sent as a common soldier to the Eastern front in World War I. In the post-World War I period Krle\u017ea established himself both as a major Modernist writer and politically controversial figure in Yugoslavia, a newly created country which encompassed South Slavic lands of the former Habsburg Empire and the kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro.\nKrle\u017ea was the driving force behind leftist literary and political reviews Plamen (The Flame) (1919), Knji\u017eevna republika (Literary Republic)  (1923\u20131927), Danas (Today) (1934) and Pe\u010dat (Seal) (1939\u20131940). He was a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia from 1918, expelled in 1939 because of his unorthodox views on art, his defense of artistic freedom against Socialist realist doctrine, and his unwillingness to give open support to the Great Purge, after the long polemic now known as \"the Conflict on the Literary Left\", pursued by Krle\u017ea with virtually every important writer in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, in the period between the two World Wars. The Party commissar sent to mediate between Krle\u017ea and other leftist and party journals was Josip Broz Tito.\nAfter the establishment of the Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia under Ante Paveli\u0107, Krle\u017ea refused to join the Partisans now headed by Tito. Following a brief period of social stigmatization after 1945 \u2013 during which he nevertheless became a very influential vice-president of the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb, while Croatia's principal state publishing house, Nakladni zavod Hrvatske, published his collected works \u2013 Krle\u017ea was eventually rehabilitated. Supported by Tito, in 1950 Krle\u017ea founded the Yugoslav Institute for Lexicography, holding the position as its head until his death. The institute would be posthumously named after him, and is now called the Miroslav Krle\u017ea Institute of Lexicography.From 1950 on, Krle\u017ea led a life of the high-profile writer and intellectual, often closely connected to Tito.  He also briefly held the post of president of the Yugoslav writers' union between 1958 and 1961. In 1962 he received the NIN Award for the novel Zastave, and in 1968 the Herder Prize.Following the deaths of Tito in May 1980, and Bela Krle\u017ea in April 1981, Krle\u017ea spent most of his last years of his life in ill health. He was awarded the Laureate Of The International Botev Prize in 1981. He died in his Villa Gvozd in Zagreb, on 29 December 1981 and was given a state funeral in Zagreb on 4 January 1982. In 1986, Villa Gvozd was donated to the City of Zagreb. It was opened to the public in 2001, but is temporarily closed due to the 2020 Zagreb earthquake damage as of 2021.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nKrle\u017ea's formative influences include Scandinavian drama, French symbolism and Austrian and German expressionism and modernism, with key authors like Ibsen, Strindberg, Nietzsche, Karl Kraus, Rilke, and Proust.Krle\u017ea's opus can be divided into the following categories:\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\nAlthough Krle\u017ea's lyric poetry is held in high regard, by common critical consensus his greatest poetic work is Balade Petrice Kerempuha (Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh), spanning more than five centuries and centred on the figure of plebeian prophet \"Petrica Kerempuh\", a Croatian Till Eulenspiegel.\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nKrle\u017ea's novelistic oeuvre consists of four works: Povratak Filipa Latinovicza (The Return of Philip Latinowicz), Na rubu pameti (On the Edge of Reason), Banket u Blitvi (The Banquet in Blitva) and Zastave (The Banners). The first one is a novel about an artist, a novel written before Sartre's Nausea. On the Edge of Reason and The Banquet in Blitva are essentially political-satires about ideas (the latter located in an imaginary Baltic country and called a political poem), saturated with the atmosphere of all-pervasive totalitarianism, while The Banners has rightly been dubbed a \"Croatian War and Peace\". It is a multi-volume panoramic view of Croatian (and Central European) society before, during, and after World War I, revolving around the prototypical theme of fathers and sons in conflict. All Krle\u017ea's novels except the last one, Zastave (The Banners), have been translated into English.\n\n\n=== Short stories and novellas ===\nThe most notable collection of Krle\u017ea's short stories is the anti-war book Hrvatski bog Mars (Croatian God Mars), on the fates of Croatian soldiers sent to the slaughterhouse of World War I battlefields.\n\n\n=== Plays ===\nKrle\u017ea's main artistic interest was centered on drama. He began with experimental expressionist plays like Adam i Eva and Michelangelo Buonarroti, dealing with defining passions of heroic figures, but eventually opted for more conventional naturalist plays. The best known is Gospoda Glembajevi (The Glembays), a cycle dealing with the decay of a bourgeois family. Golgota is another play, political in nature.\n\n\n=== Diaries and memoirs ===\nKrle\u017ea's memoirs and diaries (especially Davni dani (Olden days) and Djetinjstvo u Agramu (Childhood in Zagreb)) are fascinating documents of growing and expanding self-awareness grappling with the world outside and mutable inner self. Other masterpieces, like Dnevnici (Diaries) and posthumously published Zapisi iz Tr\u017ei\u010da (Notes from Tr\u017ei\u010d) chronicle multifarious impressions (aesthetic, political, literary, social, personal, philosophical) that an inquisitive consciousness has recorded during an era lasting more than half a century.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nHrvatski bog Mars (1922)\nGospoda Glembajevi (1928)\nPovratak Filipa Latinovicza (1932)\nBalade Petrice Kerempuha (1936)\nNa rubu pameti (1938)\nBanket u Blitvi (1939)\nZastave (1962)Translations into English:\nKrle\u017ea, Miroslav.

        "article": "Ismail Joubert (7 December 1920 \u2013 23 December 2002), commonly known as Tatamkhulu Afrika, which is Xhosa for Grandfather Africa, was a South African poet and writer. His first novel, Broken Earth was published when he was seventeen (under his \"Methodist name\"), but it was over fifty years until his next publication, a collection of verse entitled Nine Lives.\nHe won numerous literary awards including the gold Molteno Award for lifetime services to South African literature, and in 1996 his works were translated into French. His autobiography, Mr Chameleon, was published posthumously in 2005.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTatamkhulu Afrika was born Mogamed Fu'ad Nasif in Egypt to an Egyptian father and a Turkish mother, and came to South Africa as a very young child. Both his parents died of flu, and he was fostered by family friends under the name John Carlton.He fought in World War II in the North African campaign and was captured at Tobruk. His experiences as a prisoner of war featured prominently in his writing. After World War II he left his foster family and went to Namibia (then South-West Africa), where he was fostered by an Afrikaans family, taking his third legal name of Jozua Joubert.In 1964 he converted to Islam and his name was again legally changed to Ismail Joubert. He lived in Cape Town's District 6, a mixed race inner-city community. District 6 was declared a \"whites only\" area in the 1960s and the community was destroyed. With an Arab father and a Turkish mother, Afrika could have been classified as a \"white\", but refused as a matter of principle. He founded Al-Jihaad to oppose the destruction of District Six and apartheid in general, and when this became affiliated with the African National Congress' armed wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe, he was given the praise name of Tatamkhulu Afrika, which he adopted until he died.In 1987 he was arrested for terrorism and banned from speaking or writing in public for five years, although he continued writing under the name of Tatamkhulu Afrika. He was imprisoned in the same prison as Nelson Mandela and was released in 1992.Tatamkulu Afrika died on 23 December 2002 shortly after his 82nd birthday, from injuries received when he was run over by a car two weeks before, just after the publication of his final novel, Bitter Eden.

        "article": "Linwood Vrooman Carter (June 9, 1930 \u2013 February 7, 1988) was an American author of science fiction and fantasy, as well as an editor, poet and critic. He usually wrote as Lin Carter; known pseudonyms include H. P. Lowcraft (for an H. P. Lovecraft parody) and Grail Undwin. He is best known for his work in the 1970s as editor of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, which introduced readers to many overlooked classics of the fantasy genre.\n\n\n== Life ==\nCarter was born in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy in his youth, and became broadly knowledgeable in both fields. He was also active in fandom.\nCarter served in the United States Army (infantry, Korea, 1951\u201353), and then attended Columbia University and took part in Leonie Adams's Poetry Workshop (1953\u201354). He was an advertising and publishers' copywriter from 1957 until 1969, when he took up writing full-time. He was also an editorial consultant. During much of his writing career he lived in Hollis, New York.\nCarter was married twice, first to Judith Ellen Hershkovitz (married 1959, divorced 1960) and second to Noel Vreeland (married 1963, when they were both working for the publisher Prentice-Hall; divorced 1975).\nCarter was a member of the Trap Door Spiders, an all-male literary banqueting club which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery-solvers, the Black Widowers. Carter was the model for Asimov's character Mario Gonzalo. Carter was also a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose work he anthologized in the Flashing Swords! series.\nIn the 1970s Carter published one issue of his own fantasy fanzine Kadath, named after H. P. Lovecraft's fictional setting (see The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath). About 3,000 copies were printed; however the printer was in a dispute with the binder, who held the copies. While Carter paid the printer, the printer decamped into California. When Carter went to see the binder, he was told that the copies had been kept for a while, but then most had been thrown out. Carter believed that only about 30 copies of the issue survived, thus the magazine was scarcely circulated. It contained Carter's Cthulhu Mythos story \"The City of Pillars\" (pp. 22\u201325).\nCarter resided in East Orange, New Jersey, in his later years, and drank and smoked heavily. It was probably smoking that gave him oral cancer in 1985. Only his status as a Korean War veteran enabled him to receive extensive surgery. However, it failed to cure the cancer and left him disfigured. Carter held gatherings of writers under the aegis of 'the New Kalem Club' (in tribute to the original Kalem Club) - meetings which were attended by Frank Belknap Long, Robert M. Price and others.\nIn the last year before his death, he had begun to reappear in print with a new book in his Terra Magica series, a long-promised Prince Zarkon pulp hero pastiche, Horror Wears Blue, and a regular column for the magazine Crypt of Cthulhu. Despite these successes, Carter increased his alcohol intake, becoming an alcoholic. His cancer resurfaced, spreading to his throat and leading to his death in Montclair, New Jersey, in 1988.\nRobert M. Price, the editor of Crypt of Cthulhu, who had published a Lin Carter special issue (Vol. 5, No 2, whole number 36,  Yuletide 1985), was preparing a second all-Carter issue when Carter died. It was turned into a memorial issue (Vol. 7, No 4, whole number 54, Eastertide 1988). Two further issues of the magazine were devoted to Carter alone (see References below). Price was also appointed Carter's literary executor.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nA longtime science-fiction and fantasy fan, Carter first appeared in print with entertaining letters to Startling Stories and other pulp magazines in 1943 and again in the late 1940s. He issued two volumes of fantasy verse, Sandalwood and Jade (1951), technically his first book, and Galleon of Dream (1955) (see Poetry in Bibliography below) His first professional publication was the short story \"Masters of the Metropolis\", co-written with Randall Garrett, and published by Anthony Boucher in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, April 1957. Another early collaborative story, \"The Slitherer from the Slime\" (Inside SF, September 1958), by Carter, as \"H. P. Lowcraft\", with Dave Foley, is a parody of H. P. Lovecraft. The story \"Uncollected Works\" (Fantasy and SF, March 1965) was a finalist for the annual Nebula Award for Best Short Story, from the SF and fantasy writers, the only time Carter was a runner-up for a major award.Early in his efforts to establish himself as a writer, Carter gained a mentor in L. Sprague de Camp, who critiqued his novel The Wizard of Lemuria in manuscript. The seventh novel Carter wrote, it was the first to find a publisher, appearing from Ace Books in March 1965. Due in large part to their later collaborations, mutual promotion of each other in print, joint membership in both the Trap Door Spiders and SAGA, and complementary scholarly efforts to document the history of fantasy, de Camp is the person with whom Carter is most closely associated as a writer. A falling-out in the last decade of Carter's life did not become generally known until after his death.\nCarter was a prolific writer, producing an average of six books a year from 1965 to 1969. He also wrote a nearly monthly column, \"Our Man in Fandom\", in If, edited by Frederik Pohl, and was a major writer on ABC's original Spider-Man animated TV show during its fantasy-oriented second season in 1968\u201369.\nCarter frequently cited his own writings in his non-fiction and almost always included at least one of his own pieces in each of the anthologies he edited. The most extreme instance of his penchant for self-promotion is in the sixth novel in his Callisto sequence, Lankar of Callisto, which features Carter himself as the protagonist.\nCarter was not reluctant to attack organized religion in his books, notably in his unfinished epic World's End, in \"Amalric the Man-God\" (also unfinished), and in The Wizard of Zao. He portrayed religions as cruel and repressive, and had his heroes escape from their inquisitions.\nIn most of his fiction, Carter was consciously imitative of the themes, subjects and styles of authors he admired. He usually identified his models in the introductions or afterwords of his novels, as well as in the introductory notes to self-anthologized or collected short stories. His best-known works are his sword and planet and sword and sorcery novels in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, and James Branch Cabell. His first published book, The Wizard of Lemuria (1965), first of the \"Thongor the Barbarian\" series, combines both influences. Although he wrote only six Thongor novels, the character appeared in Marvel Comics's Creatures on the Loose for an eight-issue run in 1973-74 and was often optioned for films, although none has been produced. His other major series, the \"Callisto\" and \"Zanthodon\" books, are direct tributes to Burroughs' Barsoom series and Pellucidar novels, respectively.\nIn other works Carter paid homage to the styles of contemporary pulp magazine authors or their precursors. Some of these, together with Carter's models, include his \"Simrana\" stories (influenced by Lord Dunsany), his horror stories (set in the \"Cthulhu Mythos\" of H. P. Lovecraft), his \"Green Star\" novels (uniting influences from Clark Ashton Smith and Edgar Rice Burroughs), his \"Mysteries of Mars\" series (patterned on the works of Leigh Brackett), and his \"Prince Zarkon\" books (based on the \"Doc Savage\" series of Kenneth Robeson).  Later in his career Carter assimilated influences from mythology and fairy tales, and even branched out briefly into pornographic fantasy.\n\n\n== Posthumous collaborations with Howard and Smith ==\nSome of Carter's most prominent works were what he referred to as \"posthumous collaborations\" with deceased authors, notably Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith. He completed a number of Howard's unfinished tales of Kull (see Kull (collection) and Conan the Barbarian, the latter often in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp. He also collaborated with de Camp on a number of pastiche novels and short stories featuring Conan.\nThe \"posthumous collaborations\" with Smith were of a different order, usually completely new stories built around title ideas or short fragments found among Smith's notes and jottings. A number of these tales feature Smith's invented book of forbidden lore, the Book of Eibon (Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature). Some of them also overlap as pastiches of H.P. Lovecraft's work by utilising elements of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. These stories are uncollected. For further information see Steve Behrends, \"The Carter-Smith Collaborations\" in Robert M. Price (ed). The Horror of it All: Encrusted Gems from the Crypt of Cthulhu. See also Lin Carter deities.\n\n\n== Pastiches of H. P. Lovecraft and Lord Dunsany ==\nFew had escaped the holocaust of inconceivable cold that blew ravening down the boreal Pole...\nCarter wrote numerous stories in the Cthulhu Mythos of H. P. Lovecraft. Many have been collected in  The Xothic Legend Cycle: The Complete Mythos Fiction of Lin Carter, edited by Robert M. Price. Despite the title, there are many uncollected Mythos stories by Carter. See also Xothic legend cycle. For further info see Robert M. Price \"The Statement of Lin Carter\", Crypt of Cthulhu 1, No 2 (Yuletide 1981), 11\u201319.\nCarter wrote two cycles of stories set in \"dreamlands,\" paying tribute to the fantasy of Lord Dunsany, Ikranos, from his fan days, and Simrana, after he became a professional writer.\nCarter also wrote the introduction to the book, Over the Hills and Far Away.\n\n\n== Unfinished projects ==\nCarter left a number of projects unfinished. He regularly announced plans for future works that never came to fruition, even including some among lists of other works printed in the fronts of his books. His 1976 anthologies Kingdoms of Sorcery and Realms of Wizardry both included such phantom books among his other listed works, titled Robert E. Howard and the Rise of Sword & Sorcery, The Stones of Mnar and Jungle Maid of Callisto. The first of these, presumably a non-fiction study along the lines of his Tolkien: A Look Behind \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1969), never saw print; the second seems to be related to The Terror Out of Time, a collection of Cthulhu Mythos tales he had pitched unsuccessfully to Arkham House (the existing material for which was eventually gathered into his The Xothic Legend Cycle (1997)); the third was apparently a working title for Ylana of Callisto (1977), published the year after the anthologies.Several of his series were abandoned due to lack of publisher or reader interest or to his deteriorating health. Among these are his \"Thongor\" series, to which he intended to add two books dealing with the hero's youth; only a scattering of short stories intended for the volumes appeared. His \"Gondwane\" epic, which he began with the final book and afterwards added several more covering the beginning of the saga, lacks its middle volumes, his publisher having canceled the series before he managed to fill the gap between. Similarly, his projected Atlantis trilogy was canceled after the first book (The Black Star), and his five-volume \"Chronicles of Kylix\" ended with three volumes published and parts of another (Amalric).\nAnother unfinished project was Carter's self-proclaimed magnum opus, an epic literary fantasy entitled Khymyrium, or, to give it its full title, Khymyrium: The City of the Hundred Kings, from the Coming of Aviathar the Lion to the Passing of Spheridion the Doomed. It was intended to take the genre in a new direction by resurrecting the fantastic medieval chronicle history of the sort exemplified by Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae and Saxo Grammaticus's Gesta Danorum. It was also to present a new invented system of magic called \"Enstarrment\", which from Carter's description somewhat resembles the system of magical luck investment later devised by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly for their \"Liavek\" series of shared world anthologies. Carter claimed to have begun the work about 1959, and published three excerpts from it as separate short stories during his lifetime \u2013 \"Azlon\" in The Young Magicians (1969), \"The Mantichore\" in Beyond the Gates of Dream (also 1969) and \"The Sword of Power\" in New Worlds for Old (1971). A fourth episode was published posthumously in Fungi #17, a 1998 fanzine. His most comprehensive account of the project appeared in Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy in 1973. While he continued to make claims for its excellence throughout his lifetime, the complete novel never appeared. Part of the problem was that Carter was forcing himself to write the novel in a formal style more like that of William Morris and quite unlike his own.\nCarter also spoke about publishing a magazine titled Yoh-Vombis, which he intended to consist of stories he would have published in his paperback Weird Tales series had he been permitted to continue editing it. As well as new fantastic stories, he intended to publish stories and verse by Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith; unpublished letters from Smith, H. P. Lovecraft; and art by Smith, Roy Krenkel, Mahlon Blaine, etc.  However, this mooted magazine never eventuated.\n\n\n== Career as editor and critic ==\nCarter was influential as a critic of contemporary fantasy and a pioneering historian of the genre. His book reviews and surveys of the year's best fantasy fiction appeared regularly in Castle of Frankenstein, continuing after that magazine's 1975 demise in The Year's Best Fantasy Stories. His early studies of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien (Tolkien: A Look Behind \"The Lord of the Rings\") and H. P. Lovecraft (Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos) were followed up by the wide-ranging Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy, a study tracing the emergence and development of modern fantasy from the late nineteenth century novels of William Morris through the 1970s. \nPeter Beagle faulted Carter's scholarship, saying \"He gets so many facts embarrassingly wrong, so many attributions misquoted, that the entire commentary is essentially worthless.\"His greatest influence in the field may have been as an editor for Ballantine Books from 1969 to 1974, when Carter brought several then obscure yet important books of fantasy back into print under the \"Adult Fantasy\" line. Authors whose works he revived included Dunsany, Morris, Smith, James Branch Cabell, Hope Mirrlees, and Evangeline Walton. David G. Hartwell praised the series, saying it brought \"into mass editions nearly all the adult fantasy stories and novels worth reading.\"  He also helped new authors break into the field, such as Katherine Kurtz, Joy Chant, and Sanders Anne Laubenthal.\nCarter was a fantasy anthologist of note, editing a number of new anthologies of classic and contemporary fantasy for Ballantine and other publishers. He also edited several anthology series, including the Flashing Swords! series from 1973 to 1981, the first six volumes of The Year's Best Fantasy Stories for DAW Books from 1975 to 1980, and an anthology format revival of the classic fantasy magazine Weird Tales from 1981 to 1983.\nTogether with SAGA he sponsored the Gandalf Award, an early fantasy equivalent to science fiction's Hugo Award, for the recognition of outstanding merit in authors and works of fantasy. It was given annually by the World Science Fiction Society from 1974 to 1981, but went into abeyance with the collapse of Carter's health in the 1980s. Its primary purpose continues to be fulfilled by the initially rival World Fantasy Awards, first presented in 1975.\n\n\n== Posthumous revival ==\nWildside Press began an extensive program returning much of Carter's fiction to print in 1999. All remain in print, and one original book was issued in 2012, collecting the short stories about Thongor. See the bibliography for Wildside reissues.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nNova Award, 1972.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBallantine Adult Fantasy Series\nSwordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America\nTrap Door Spiders\nBlack Widowers\nGandalf Award\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nCarter, Lin (1973).

        "article": "Ivan Minchov Vazov (Bulgarian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u041c\u0438\u043d\u0447\u043e\u0432 \u0412\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432; 9 July [O.S. 27 June] 1850 \u2013 22 September 1921) was a Bulgarian poet, novelist and playwright, often referred to as \"the Patriarch of Bulgarian literature\". He was born in Sopot, a town in the Rose Valley of Bulgaria (then part of the Ottoman Empire). The works of Ivan Vazov reveal two historical epochs - the Bulgarian Renaissance and the Post-Liberation (from Ottoman Empire rule) epoch. Ivan Vazov holds the highest honorary title of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences - Academician. He acted as Education and People Enlightenment Minister from September 7, 1897, until January 30, 1899, representing the People's Party.\n\n\n== Biography and major works ==\nThe exact date of Vazov's birth is disputed. His parents, Saba and Mincho Vazov, both had a lot of influence on the young poet.\nAfter Ivan finished primary school in Sopot, Mincho sent him to Kalofer, appointing him assistant teacher. Having done his final exams in Kalofer, the young teacher returned to Sopot to help in his father's grocery. The following year his father sent him to Plovdiv to Naiden Gerov's school. There Vazov made his first steps as a poet.\nHe returned to Sopot only to leave for Olteni\u021ba in Romania, as his father wanted him to become an apprentice and study trade at his uncle's. Ivan Vazov showed no interest in the trade profession whatsoever. Instead he was immersed in literature. Soon he fled from his uncle's place and went to Br\u0103ila where he lived with the Bulgarian exiled revolutionaries and met Hristo Botev, a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet.\nIn 1874, he joined the struggle for his country's independence from the Ottoman Empire. He returned to Sopot in 1875, where he became a member of the local revolutionary committee. After the failure of the April Uprising of 1876, he had to flee the country, going back to Gala\u0163i, where most of the surviving revolutionaries were exiled. There he was appointed a secretary of the committee.\nVazov was probably heavily influenced by Botev, who was the ideological leader of the Bulgarian revolutionary movement. He started writing his famous poems with Botev and some other Bulgarian emigrants in Romania. In 1876 he published his first work, Priaporetz and Gusla, followed by \"Bulgaria's Sorrows\" in 1877.\nBulgaria regained its independence in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War and Vazov wrote the famous Epic of the Forgotten. He became the editor of the political reviews Science and Dawn. He was, however, forced into exile once again, this time to Odessa, because of the persecution of the russophile political faction. Returning to Bulgaria with the help of his mother Suba Vazova, he started teaching. Vazov's next stay was in Svishtov, where he became a civil servant.\n\nHe moved to Sofia in 1889 where he started publishing the review Dennitsa.\nVazov's 1888 novel Under the Yoke, which depicts the Ottoman oppression of Bulgaria, is the most famous piece of classic Bulgarian literature and has been translated into over 30 languages.Later in his life Vazov was a prominent and widely respected figure in the social and cultural life of newly independent Bulgaria. He died on September 22, 1921.\n\n\n== Other famous works ==\nSome of the other famous works by Vazov include the novels New Country (1894), Under Our Heaven (1900), The Empress of Kazalar (1902), Songs of Macedonia (1914),  It Will Not Perish  (1920) and the plays Vagabonds (1894), A Newspaperman? (1900), Borislav (1909) and Ivaylo (1911).\nVazov also wrote the first Bulgarian science fiction story The Last Day of XX Century (1899), the first Bulgarian fantasy poem In the Kingdom of the Fairies (1884) and some other fantasy poetry.\n\n\n== Historical site ==\n\nVazov's home in Sofia has been turned into a museum, containing a restoration of his residence with period furnishings, as well as Vazov's taxidermically preserved dog.  Although the museum is ostensibly open Tuesday through Saturday, it is in practice not always staffed, so visitors are advised to call in advance.  The museum is located at the corner of Ivan Vazov Street and Georgi S. Rakovski Street in Sofia.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nThe Bulgarian Ivan Vazov National Theatre in Sofia is named after him, the \"Ivan Vazov\" neighborhood in Sofia, as is the Ivan Vazov National Library (Bulgarian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0430 \"\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\") in Plovdiv. A park near St. Sofia Church in Sofia features the city's best-known monument to Vazov.\nVazovova Street in Bratislava, Slovakia, and Vazov Point and Vazov Rock on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are also named after him.In 1917, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBulgarian literature\nZahari Stoyanov\nPencho Slaveykov\nPeyo Yavorov\nNational awakening of Bulgaria\n\n\n== References ==\nBull, Lucy Catlin (1897). \"Ivan Vazoff (1850 -)\".

        "article": "Witi Tame Ihimaera-Smiler  (; born 7 February 1944) is a New Zealand author. Raised in the small town of Waituhi, he decided to become a writer as a teenager after being convinced that M\u0101ori people were ignored or mischaracterised in literature. He was the first M\u0101ori writer to publish a collection of short stories, with Pounamu, Pounamu (1972), and the first to publish a novel, with Tangi (1973). After his early works he took a ten-year break from writing, during which he focused on editing an anthology of M\u0101ori writing in English. \nFrom the late 1980s onwards he wrote prolifically. In his novels, plays, short stories and opera librettos, he examines contemporary M\u0101ori culture, legends and history, and the impacts of colonisation in New Zealand. He has said that \"M\u0101ori culture is the taonga, the treasure vault from which I source my inspiration\". His 1987 novel The Whale Rider is his best-known work, read widely by children and adults both in New Zealand and overseas. It was adapted into the critically acclaimed 2002 film Whale Rider directed by Niki Caro. His semi-autobiographical novel Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1996) was about a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality. In later works he has dealt with historical events such as the campaign of non-violent resistance at Parihaka in the late nineteenth century.  \nHe is an influential figure in New Zealand literature, and over his long career has won numerous awards and fellowships, including multiple awards for both fiction and non-fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards spanning the period 1973 to 2016, the Robert Burns Fellowship (1975), the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship (1993), and a Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement (2017). Until 2010 he was the Professor of English and Distinguished Creative Fellow in M\u0101ori Literature at the University of Auckland. He has since published two volumes of his memoirs: M\u0101ori Boy: A Memoir of Childhood (2014) and Native Son: The Writer's Memoir (2019).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIhimaera was born in Gisborne, a city in the east of New Zealand's North Island and is of M\u0101ori descent. His iwi (tribe) is Te Aitanga-a-M\u0101haki. He has affiliations to Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe, Te Wh\u0101nau-\u0101-Apanui, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu, Ng\u0101i T\u0101manuhiri, Rongowhakaata, Ng\u0101ti Porou, and Whakat\u014dhea. He also has Scottish ancestry through both parents. His family marae is Te Rongopai Marae in Waituhi, and he grew up in Waituhi\u2014many of his stories are set in a fictional recreation of the town. He began writing at a young age, and in later life recounted writing stories on the wall of his childhood bedroom.He attended Te Karaka District High School for three years and the Church College of New Zealand in Temple View, Hamilton, for one year, after which he completed his final year of schooling at Gisborne Boys' High School. He has said that he became interested in becoming a writer when he was fifteen and realised that M\u0101ori did not feature in the books he read. His schoolteacher then instructed his class to read the short story \"The Whare\" by P\u0101keh\u0101 writer Douglas Stewart, about a young man who encounters a M\u0101ori settlement. He found the story \"so poisonous\" that he threw the book out of the window and was caned for doing so. Writing about the incident in his 2014 memoir M\u0101ori Boy, he said:\nMy ambition to be a writer was voiced that day. I said to myself that I was going to write a book about M\u0101ori people, not just because it had to be done but because I needed to unpoison the stories already written about M\u0101ori; and it would be taught in every school in New Zealand, whether they wanted it or not.\nAfter high school, Ihimaera attended the University of Auckland for three years, from 1963 to 1966, but did not complete his degree, and returned to Gisborne where he became a cadet journalist for the Gisborne Herald. He subsequently became a postman, moved to Wellington and started studying part-time at Victoria University of Wellington, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He met librarian and student Jane Cleghorn at university, and they married in 1970.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career: 1960s and 1970s ===\nIhimaera began writing seriously in 1969, around age 25, and had his first short story \"The Liar\" accepted for publication by the New Zealand Listener magazine in May 1970. His first book, Pounamu Pounamu (1972), was a collection of short stories, which was awarded third prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards in 1973. Ihimaera has said it was rejected by three publishers before being accepted by the fourth. His first two novels were published in quick succession: Tangi (1973), which won first prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards in 1974, and Whanau (1974), which told the story of a day in the life of a M\u0101ori village. He was the first M\u0101ori writer to publish a collection of short stories and the first to publish a novel.Norman Kirk, then the prime minister of New Zealand, read Pounamu Pounamu and arranged for Ihimaera to be employed as a writer at the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1973. During his career he wrote a non-fiction booklet called M\u0101ori (1975), later adapted into a short film of the same name in 1981, although he felt the final film was a propaganda exercise that bore little resemblance to his written work. He subsequently worked as a diplomat with posts in Canberra, New York City, and Washington, D.C. In 1975 he was the recipient of the Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago, and in 1982 he received a Victoria University of Wellington writing fellowship.Beginning in 1975, Ihimaera stopped his own creative writing for a ten-year period, due to his belief that it was \"tragically out of date\" and a wish not to have it seen as the \"definitive portrayal of the world of the Maori\". He instead began working on the anthology Into the World of Light (1982) together with co-editor Don Long. The anthology collected the work of 39 M\u0101ori writers. In Ihimaera and Long's introduction, they said that M\u0101ori oral tradition formed the context for M\u0101ori literature, and observed that the apparent lack of M\u0101ori writing in the mid-20th century was due to publishers' reluctance to publish books by M\u0101ori writers because of a belief that M\u0101ori \"don't read books\". The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature described the collected works as being \"of a uniformly high standard\", and Graham Wiremu writing in the New Zealand Listener called the anthology \"prodigious and powerful\".\n\n\n=== Return to writing: 1980s and 1990s ===\nWhen Ihimaera began writing again, he wrote The Matriarch (1986) which examined the impacts of European colonisation on M\u0101ori, and which again received first prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards. Not long after publication, it came to light that Ihimaera had used passages from the entry on M\u0101ori land in An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand (1966), written by Keith Sorrenson, without acknowledgement. Ihimaera apologised to Sorrenson at the time. Mark Williams later noted that the consequences for Ihimaera were minor, and he became a professor in the year of the book's publication. He also wrote a libretto for an opera by Ross Harris, based on his second novel Whanau, and Dear Miss Mansfield (1989), a rewriting of Katherine Mansfield's short stories from a M\u0101ori perspective, in response to celebrations of 100 years since her birth. The collection was well-received overseas but criticised by New Zealand reviewers for a perceived lack of respect for Mansfield.In a three-week period Ihimaera wrote his best-known work The Whale Rider (1987), the story of a young girl becoming a leader of her people. It has been reprinted many times, read by both adults and children, and was adapted into the critically acclaimed film of the same name in 2002.  It won the Nielsen BookData New Zealand Booksellers' Choice Award in 2003. It was published and read internationally; Kirkus Reviews described it as a \"luminous joining of myth and contemporary culture\".In 1989 he left his job as a diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the following year he became a lecturer in the English department at the University of Auckland. He later became Professor of English and Distinguished Creative Fellow in M\u0101ori Literature, until 2010. He was awarded a Scholarship in Letters in 1991. In 1993 he received the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Fellowship which allowed him to work in Menton, France, for a period, where he wrote his next two novels: Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies (1994) and Nights in the Gardens of Spain (1996). Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies was awarded the prize for Fiction at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards in 1995. It was described in The Dominion Post as \"a rollicking good yarn about Maori rural life in the 1950s\", and Ihimaera himself has said he was intending to write a M\u0101ori Western. The novel was adapted into the 2016 film Mahana by Lee Tamahori (released as The Patriarch outside of New Zealand).In 1996 he published Nights in the Gardens of Spain, a semi-autobiographical novel about a man coming out. Like Ihimaera, the main character was married with two daughters, but unlike Ihimaera the main character was P\u0101keh\u0101 (European). Ihimaera had accepted his sexuality in 1984 and began the work, but out of sensitivity to his daughters, did not finish or publish it then. The novel was described by scholar Roger Robinson as featuring \"conflict, growth and reconciliation, with subplots heroic, political and tragic\". Robinson said it was \"no small achievement to take this material off the grubby walls of public toilets, free it from sleaze, write it with vivid passion and through it affirm and celebrate a way of life of which most of us know almost nothing\". In a review for The Dominion Post, Gavin McLean described it as Ihimaera's best book to date, and noted that much of the book's impact came from the intensity of the main character's relationship with his parents and his \"desperate need to do better by his children\"; \"Unlike characters in many similar novels, coming out does not mean discarding all one's past.\" In 2010, it was adapted into the film Kawa by director Katie Wolfe. The central character was changed from P\u0101keh\u0101 to M\u0101ori businessman Kawa, played by Calvin Tuteao. In an article in The Sunday Star Times, Ihimaera was quoted as saying the change \"was quite a shock to me because I had always tried to hide, to say 'this is a book that could be about \"everyman\", this is not a specific story'. So [the film] is now actually nearer to the truth than I would like to admit.\" After the publication of the novel, Ihimaera and his wife remained married, but no longer lived together.A decade after his anthology Into the World of Light (1982), Ihimaera edited the five-volume bilingual anthology of M\u0101ori writing, Te Ao Maramara (\"the world of light\"), published between 1992 to 1996. It represented the most comprehensive collection of writing by M\u0101ori writers that had been published at that time. In 1997 he published The Dream Swimmer, a sequel to his 1986 novel The Matriarch. That same year, Mataora, The Living Face: Contemporary M\u0101ori Artists, which he co-edited with Sandy Adsett and Cliff Whiting, received the Montana Award for Illustrative Arts at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. His poem \"O numi tutelar\" was recited at the dawn opening of the British Museum's long-awaited 'Maori' Exhibition in 1998.\n\n\n=== Later career: 2000 onwards ===\n\nIn the early 2000s Ihimaera published Woman Far Walking (2000), a play from the perspective of an elder M\u0101ori woman who has witnessed key historic events and who Ihimaera describes as the personification of the Treaty of Waitangi. He also published The Uncle's Story (2000), a love story about two generations of gay M\u0101ori men, children's picture book The Little Kowhai Tree (2002) (illustrated by Henry Campbell), and the novel Sky Dancer (2003), featuring M\u0101ori myths with contemporary characters. Sky Dancer was shortlisted for Best Book in the South Pacific & South East Asian Region of the 2004 Commonwealth Writers' Prize. In 2004, he published Whanau II, which featured the characters of his second novel Whanau (1974), and which was subsequently published in London under the title Band of Angels (2005). His novella \"The Halcyon Summer\" was published in Nine New Zealand Novellas (2005), edited by Peter Simpson. The Rope of Man was published in 2005, which featured both a revised version of his first novel Tangi (1973) and a new sequel The Return. His short story collection Ask at the Posts of the House (2007) was longlisted for the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, and one of the novellas included in that collection was adapted into the 2013 film White Lies. In 2003, and again in 2009, Penguin New Zealand published His Best Stories, a collection of twenty-four stories selected by Ihimaera.In 2009, Ihimaera published The Trowenna Sea, a novel about the early history of Tasmania. At the time, he planned to write a trilogy. Shortly after publication, book reviewer Jolisa Gracewood detected short passages from other writers, especially from historical sources, used without acknowledgement. Ihimaera apologised for not acknowledging the passages, said the omission was inadvertent and negligent, and pointed to many pages of other sources that he had acknowledged. The University of Auckland investigated the incident and ruled that Ihimaera's actions did not constitute misconduct in research, as the actions did not appear to be deliberate and Ihimaera had apologised. Gracewood subsequently found additional passages that had been copied without explanation, and the book's publisher Penguin Books removed the book from public sale. Ihimaera purchased the remaining stock himself. A revised edition, with fuller acknowledgements, originally planned for 2010, was subsequently cancelled, with no reasons given for the decision. Some literary commentators, such as Vincent O'Sullivan, C.K. Stead and Mark Williams, criticised the university's response to the incident. Keith Sorrenson said that the events suggested Ihimaera had \"learnt nothing\" from his earlier plagiarism of Sorrenson's work in The Matriarch (1986).His twelfth novel, The Parihaka Woman (2011), featured elements of the opera Fidelio and the history of Parihaka and the campaign of non-violent resistance. Michael O'Leary, writing in the online edition of Landfall, called it an \"intriguing and significant, if somewhat flawed, work\"; he praised the novel's efforts to tackle the horrific events at Parihaka in the late nineteenth century, and the demonstration of the rich cultural life of M\u0101ori in that period, but also noted some issues in the detail of Ihimaera's use of M\u0101ori lore and in historical accuracies. Reviewers for the Sunday Star-Times, Otago Daily Times and The New Zealand Herald were more negative, and all noted Ihimaera's use of an amateur historian as narrator; they noted that this device allowed him to add numerous citations and references, and avoid any further accusations of plagiarism, but detracted from the quality of the writing. It was followed by the short-story collection The Thrill of Falling (2012), in which Ihimaera explored a range of genres including contemporary comedy and science fiction.M\u0101ori Boy: A Memoir of Childhood (2014) was the first instalment of Ihimaera's memoirs, and recorded experiences from his childhood up till his teenage years. It received the award for General Non-Fiction at the 2016 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. The second instalment, Native Son: A Writer's Memoir was published in 2019, and covers his early adult years in the 1960s and 1970s and how he became a published writer. After finishing Native Son, he decided to take a four-year break from writing, but ended up instead writing Navigating the Stars: M\u0101ori Creation Myths (2020), a modern re-telling of traditional Maori legends. Ihimaera wrote the script for a stage show adaptation of Navigating the Stars, produced by theatre company Taki Rua, which was performed at the Soundshell in the Wellington Botanic Garden in early 2021.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\nIhimaera has been recognised as \"one of the world's leading indigenous writers\". Literary scholar and Professor Emeritus at the University of Otago Alistair Fox in The Ship of Dreams: Masculinity in Contemporary New Zealand Fiction (2008) devotes four of the eleven chapters in the book to the writings of Ihimaera, indicating his importance within the context of New Zealand literature. Fox describes his epic novel The Matriarch as \"one of the major and most telling 'monuments' of New Zealand's cultural history in the late twentieth century as far as the situation of M\u0101ori in this postcolonial society is concerned\", noting that Ihimaera \"has remained at the forefront of M\u0101ori arts and letters to an unprecedented degree, with an impressive output across a range of genres\".As part of the Auckland Arts Festival 2011, musician Charlotte Yates directed and produced the stage project \"Ihimaera\", featuring Ihimaera's lyrics about his life and works, and with performances by New Zealand musicians including Victoria Girling-Butcher, Paul Ubana Jones, Ruia Aperahama and Horomona Horo. Yates had previously created similar projects as tributes to New Zealand poets James K. Baxter and Hone T\u016bwhare, and chose Ihimaera for her third project because he was \"a writer with a huge body of work that I can give to a number of musicians for them to put their heart and soul to\".\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIn the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours, Ihimaera was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services. In the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to literature. In 2009, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, he declined redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.In 2004, Ihimaera received an honorary doctorate from Victoria University of Wellington. In the same year he undertook a residency in world literature at George Washington University, funded by Fulbright New Zealand. In 2009 he was one of five recipients of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Award, for which he received NZ$50,000. In the same year he received the prestigious M\u0101ori arts award Te Tohutiketike a Te Waka Toi at the 2009 Creative New Zealand Te Waka Toi Awards. The award is made to artists who are \"exemplary in their chosen field of artistic endeavour\". On receiving the award, Ihimaera said it was a recognition of his iwi: \"Without them, I would have nothing to write about and there would be no Ihimaera. So this award is for all those ancestors who have made us all the people we are. It is also for the generations to come, to show them that even when you aren't looking, destiny has a job for you to do.\"In 2017, Ihimaera was awarded a Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement. The selection panel described him \"as one of New Zealand's most important post-colonial writers, who has consistently proved to be an outstanding storyteller, celebrated as a voice for M\u0101oritanga and a literary leader\". In the same year, he was appointed a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres on Bastille Day by the French government for his \"pivotal role in bringing Maori storytelling to the forefront and enabling its international recognition as a taonga from New Zealand\".\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Novels, short-story collections and non-fiction ===\n\n\n=== Anthologies and other edited works ===\n\n\n=== Other works ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of honorary doctors of Victoria University of Wellington\nLiterature of New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM\u0101ori-language biography, including list of works\u2014At M\u0101ori Wikipedia\nRead NZ Te Pou Muramura biography\nExtensive bibliography in the New Zealand Literature File, archived copy as at 11 March 2008"

He is considered one of the most significant modern Saudi authors and one of the best in the Arabic language of the 20th century. His novels include strong political elements as well as mockeries of the Middle Eastern elite classes. His work offended the rulers of Saudi Arabia which led to the banning of many of his books and the revocation of his Saudi Arabian citizenship.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMunif was born in 1933 as a Saudi national and brought up in Amman, Jordan to Saudi Arabian parents, and his grandmother was an Iraqi. In 1952 he moved to Baghdad to study law and later moved to Cairo. He received a law degree from the Sorbonne and a PhD in oil economics from the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics. He later returned to Iraq to work in the oil ministry and became a member of the Ba'ath Party.  During this time he edited an industry journal called al-Naft wa al-Tanmiya \"Petroleum and Development\".He began writing in the 1970s after he left his job with the Iraqi ministry, quit the Ba'ath party, and moved to Damascus, Syria, removing himself from a regime he opposed. He quickly became known for his scathing parodies of Middle Eastern elites, especially those of Saudi Arabia, a country which banned many of his books and stripped him of Saudi citizenship. He used his knowledge of the oil industry to full effect criticizing the businessmen who ran it and the politicians they served.\nMunif was the author of fifteen novels. The Cities of Salt quintet followed the evolution of the Arabian peninsula as its traditional Bedouin culture was transformed by the oil boom. The novels portray the history of a broad region, evoking comparisons to William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. The quintet begins with Mudun al-Milh (\u0645\u062f\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u062d, Cities of Salt, 1984), depicting the desert oasis of Wadi al-Uyoun as it is transformed and destroyed by the arrival of Western oilmen, a story similar to that of the disrupted village of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. Much as Achebe described the effects of the arrival of powerful missionaries on a traditional African village, so Munif chronicles the economic, social, and psychological effects of the promise of immeasurable wealth drawn from the deserts of nomad and oasis communities. The quintet continues with Al-ukhdud (1985;The Trench), Taqasim al-layl wa-al-nahar (1989; Variations on Night and Day), Al-munbatt (1989; The Uprooted), and Badiyat al zulumat (1989; The Desert of Darkness). Daniel Burt ranked the quintet as the 71st greatest novel of all time. The last two novels in the series have not been translated into English.\nHis first novel to appear in English was Endings.  The translator called it the first Saudi novel translated into English, and hailed its innovative portrayal of rural life and environmental challenges in an Arabic genre which had, until then, focused mostly on urban, middle-class experiences.While his works were never particularly successful in the West, throughout the Middle East they are critically acclaimed and extremely popular. Cities of Salt was described by Edward Said as the \"only serious work of fiction that tries to show the effect of oil, Americans and the local oligarchy on a Gulf country.\"While he was one of the fiercest critics of Saddam Hussein and his regime, he was utterly opposed to the American invasion of Iraq and spent the last two years of his life working on non-fiction projects to oppose what he saw as renewed imperialism.

His father was from a Portuguese background, his mother Basque. Amorim travelled extensively in Europe and Latin America, developing acquaintanceships and friendships with many of the leading literary figures of his time. He eventually had a house built in Salto, designed by Le Corbusier.\nIn the 1920s Amorim wrote for the Argentine leftist magazine Los Pensadores and published with the press Claridad, both associated with the left-leaning Buenos Aires-based Boedo group.\nIn 1947 Amorim officially joined the Communist Party of Uruguay. He was also responsible for the erection of a monument in Salto to commemorate Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, the poet and playwright killed by Francisco Franco's forces in the opening weeks of the Spanish Civil War.\nHe is mentioned in Borges' story \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\".\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n== Reference ==\nK.E.A.

        "article": "Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai (Chinese: \u767d\u5148\u52c7; pinyin: B\u00e1i Xi\u0101ny\u01d2ng; Wade\u2013Giles: Pai Hsien-yung, born July 11, 1937) is a Chinese writer from Taiwan who has been described as a \"melancholy pioneer\". He was born in Guilin, Guangxi at the cusp of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Pai's father was the Kuomintang (KMT) general Bai Chongxi (Pai Chung-hsi), whom he later described as a \"stern, Confucian father\" with \"some soft spots in his heart.\"  Pai was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the age of seven, during which time he would have to live in a separate house from his siblings (of which he would have a total of nine).  He lived with his family in Chongqing, Shanghai, and Nanjing before moving to the British-controlled Hong Kong in 1948 as CPC forces turned the tide of the Chinese Civil War. In 1952, Pai and his family resettled in Taiwan, where the KMT had relocated the Republic of China after defeat by the Communists in 1949.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\nPai studied in La Salle College, a Hong Kong Catholic boys' high school, until he left for Taiwan with his family.  In 1956, Pai enrolled at National Cheng Kung University as a hydraulic engineering major, because he wanted to participate in the Three Gorges Dam Project. The following year, he passed the entrance examination for the foreign literature department of National Taiwan University and transferred there to study English literature. In September 1958, after completing his first year of study, he published his first short story \"Madame Ching\" in the magazine Literature.  Two years later, he collaborated with several NTU classmates\u2014e.g., Chen Ruoxi, Wang Wen-hsing, Ouyang Tzu\u2014to launch Modern Literature (Xiandai wenxue), in which many of his early works were published.  He was also known to frequent the Cafe Astoria in Taipei.Pai went abroad in 1963 to study literary theory and creative writing at the University of Iowa in the Iowa Writers' Workshop. That same year, Pai's mother, the parent with whom Pai had the closest relationship, died, and it was this death to which Pai attributes the melancholy that pervades his work.  After earning his M.A. from Iowa, he became a professor of Chinese literature at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and has resided in Santa Barbara ever since. Pai retired from UCSB in 1994.  Pai's cousin is Hong Kong radio personality Pamela Peck.\n\n\n== Major works ==\nPai's most famous work of fiction, Taipei People (\u81fa\u5317\u4eba; T\u00e1ib\u011bi r\u00e9n, 1971), is a seminal work of Chinese modernism that mixes both literary Chinese and experimental modernist techniques. In terms of his choice of themes, Pai's work is also far ahead of its time. His novel, Crystal Boys (\u5b7d\u5b50; Ni\u00e8z\u01d0, 1983), tells the story of a group of homosexual youths living in 1960s Taipei, largely from the viewpoint of a gay youth who is thrown out of his father's home.  The novel's comparison of the dark corners of Taipei's New Park, the characters' main cruising area, with the cloistered society of Taiwan of that period proved quite unacceptable to Taipei's then KMT-dominated establishment, though Pai has generally remained a loyal KMT supporter.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nAmong other writers in Taiwan, Pai is appreciated for sophisticated narratives that introduce controversial and groundbreaking perspectives to Chinese literature. His major works, discussed above, have been widely influential.\nFurther, Pai's writings while in the US in the early 1960s have greatly contributed to an understanding of the Chinese experience in postwar America. \"Death in Chicago\" (1964) is a semi-autobiographical account of a young Chinese man who, on the eve of his graduation from the English Literature department of the University of Chicago, discovers that his mother has died back home. \"Pleasantville\" (1964) explores the depressed state of a Chinese mother in the upper-class New York suburbs who feels alienated by the Americanization of her Chinese husband and daughter. Both \"Death in Chicago\" and \"Pleasantville\" subtly criticize America as a superficial and materialistic culture that can cause immigrant Chinese to feel lonely and isolated.\nIn recent years, Pai has gained some acclaim in Mainland Chinese literary circles. He has held various lectures at Beijing Normal University, among others. In the Beijing University Selection of Modern Chinese Literature: 1949\u20131999 published in 2002, three of Pai's works are included under the time period 1958\u20131978. These stories reflect the decadence of Shanghai high society in the Republican era. This subject matter constitutes only a small segment of Pai's diverse work, yet it fits particularly well with orthodox renditions of pre-1949 history taught on the Mainland.\nIn April 2000, a series of five books representing Pai's lifework was published by Huacheng Publishing House in Guangzhou. This series is widely available in Mainland bookstores. It includes short stories, essays, diary entries, and the novel Niezi. A lengthy preface in Volume 1 was penned by Ou Yangzi, a fellow member of the group that founded the journal Xiandai Wenxue in Taiwan in the 1950s.Pai was born Muslim, attended missionary Catholic schools and embraced Buddhist meditation practices in the United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Portrait ==\nBai Xianyong.

        "article": "Mariano Azuela Gonz\u00e1lez (January 1, 1873 \u2013 March 1, 1952) was a Mexican author and physician, best known for his fictional stories of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. He wrote novels, works for theatre and literary criticism. He is the first of the \"novelists of the Revolution,\" and he influenced other Mexican novelists of social protest.\nAmong Azuela's first published writing were some short pieces for the magazine Gil Blas C\u00f3mico, where he wrote under the pen name of \"Bele\u00f1o\", and his writing published under the heading Impresiones de un estudiante (Impressions of a Student) in 1896. His first novel, Maria Luisa, was written in 1907, followed by Los fracasados (The Failures) in 1908, and Mala yerba (Weeds) in 1909. The theme of his beginning novels are about fate. He wrote of the social life of Mexicans during the D\u00edaz dictatorship. After experiencing the Mexican Revolution first-hand, his writing style became sarcastic and disillusioned. His first novel with the Revolution theme is Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, maderista in 1911, followed by Sin Amor (Without Love) in 1912, and his most popular, Los de abajo (The Underdogs) in 1915. He continued to write short works and novels influenced by the Revolution. It includes El camarada Pantoja (Comrade Pantoja) in 1937, Regina Landa in 1939, La nueva burgues\u00eda (The New Bourgeoisie) in 1941, and La maldici\u00f3n (The Curse, published posthumously) in 1955. These works mainly depicts the satirical picture of life in post revolutionary Mexico sharply and angrily stigmatizing demagoguery and political intrigue.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nAzuela was born in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco to a small, but successful rancher, Evaristo Azuela and Paulina Azuela, on January 1, 1873. He grew up in a small farm owned by his father, which later influences the settings in many of his fictional works. He was first admitted to a Catholic seminary at the age of fourteen, but soon abandoned his religious studies. He studied medicine in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He received his M.D. in 1899, practicing medicine first in his home town of Lagos de Moreno, and later, after the Mexican revolution, practiced in Mexico City. In 1900, he married Carmen Rivera, niece of Agust\u00edn Rivera, priest and historian of Lagos de Moreno. He went to have five sons and five daughters.\nLike most young students, Azuela was opposed to the dictatorship of the D\u00edaz regime. During his days in the Mexican Revolution, Azuela wrote about the war and its impact on Mexico. When Porfirio D\u00edaz was overthrown, Azuela was made Chief of Political Affairs of Lagos de Moreno in 1911 and state Director of Education of Jalisco in 1914 by president Francisco I. Madero. After Madero's assassination, he joined the Constitutionalist cause that sought to restore the rule of law. He traveled with the military forces of Juli\u00e1n Medina, a follower of Pancho Villa, where he served as a field doctor. His participation in the conflict gave him ample material to write Los de abajo (The Underdogs) (1915). He later was forced for a time to emigrate to El Paso, Texas when the counterrevolutionary forces of Victoriano Huerta were temporarily triumphant. It was there that he wrote Los de abajo, which was his first-hand description of combat during the Mexican revolution, based on his experiences in the field. It was first published as a serial in the newspaper \"El Paso del Norte\" from October 1915 to December 1915. The book did not receive general recognition until 1924, and it was hailed as a novel of the Revolution. Los de abajo (The Underdogs) depicts the futility of the Revolution, the opportunists in power, and the underprivileged majority of his country. He fought for a better Mexico, and he believed the Revolution corrected some injustices, but it has given rise to others equally deplorable.\n\n\n== The Mexican Revolution\u2019s Effect on Mariano Azuela\u2019s Writing Career ==\nThrough studying the encyclopedic entries of Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos, Brown Foundation Professor of Hispanic Studies teaching at the University of Houston, in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Latino Literature discussing Mariano Azuela's involvement in The Mexican Revolution, the strong influence and lasting impressions of the revolution on his writing career become evident.\nIn his encyclopedia entry \u201cAzuela, Mariano (1873-1952)\u201d, Nicol\u00e1s Kanellos underscores Azuela's physical involvement in the war, and its influence on Azuela's literary career. Kanellos begins by describing Azuela as, \u201cone of Mexico\u2019s greatest novelists and chroniclers of the Mexican Revolution\u201d (Kanellos, 105). In describing Azuela as a \u201cchronicler\u201d, Kanellos immediately highlights one important feature of Azuela and his work, which is his tendency to record and portray history. In highlighting Azuela's relationship between history and literature, Kanellos establishes the inseparability of political and global contexts within Azuela's literary works; for example, Azuela's novel \u201cThe Underdogs\u201d recounts the events of The Mexican Revolution from the perspective of the rebel soldiers. Therefore, Kanellos emphasizes the existing relationship between history and its involvement in Azuela's work. Kanellos then describes the reason as to why Azuela's literary works are deeply infused with Mexican politics and history stating, \u201cAzuela\u2019s early career as a writer, in fact, was developed while participating in the Revolution first-hand as a physician in the army of Francisco \u2018Pancho\u2019 Villa\u201d (Kanellos, 105). The terms \u201cfirst-hand\u201d and \u201cparticipating\u201d underscore Azuela's physical involvement in the war. Kanellos\u2019 use of the word \u201cdeveloped\u201d then underscores the manner in which Azuela's physical involvement paved the way for his writing to grow and mature as a result of his experiences participating in the Mexican Revolution. Kanellos stresses in his encyclopedic entry the persisting role of history and its portrayal in Azuela's work, but he also emphasizes the manner in history, in particular the Mexican Revolution, essentially birthed Azuela's writing career.\nIn understanding the relationship between Mariano Azuela's involvement in the Mexican Revolution and its effect on his writing career, the undertones of corruption and failed ideals in Azuela's novels such as \u201cThe Underdogs\u201d reveal a more personal perspective that highlights the contrasts between the reality of war and revolution in his novels.\n\n\n== Cultural Identity in The Underdogs ==\nIn Margy McCrary's article, \u201cThe Aztec Connection: Exploring the Construction of Azuela's Revolutionaries in The Underdogs\u201d, she examines the description of Demetrio as a \u201cfull-blooded Aztec\u201d. She argues he gains authority over the land, and constructs a cultural identity where he and Mexican peasants must establish in order to resist the Spanish conquerors.  McCrary contends that the purpose of a revolution is to reject the identity of the colonizer, but in order to do this \u201csome sort of unified identity is necessary for a group to revolt successfully\u201d (McCrary 31). The pre-colonial Aztec is embodied by Demetrio Mac\u00edas because he is connected to both his ancestors and the land. Demetrio is depicted as \u201criding proudly on his horse\u201d with \u201cpure-blooded Aztec cheeks\u201d, however, Demetrio \u201cseems devoid of any defined identity\u201d because he never acknowledges a greater reasoning to his involvement in the revolution other than either revenge or satisfaction in being the revolutionaries' leader (Azuela 72). This illuminates that Azuela may care about the revolution more than the characters do. McCrary further explains that on page seventy-two of the novel, Macias and his \u201cmen threw out their chests as if to breathe the widening horizon\u201d and the \u201cimmensity of the sky\u201d illustrating how Demetrio's freedom is connected to the earth itself and that Demetrio is a legitimate inhabitant of the land. Furthermore, the sense of freedom that Demetrio and the Mexican men feel on the land serves to \u201cdistance them from their oppressed identities as colonized beings\u201d because they immediately forget their bleak lives as conquered peasants (36). By depicting Demetrio as a pure-blooded Aztec, Azuela reveals that he as an author is \u201cdispleased with the current, colonized identity of his people\u201d and wishes to reconstruct a strong Mexican identity before it had \u201cbeen influenced by the Spanish colonizers\u201d (37). As a result, Azuela emphasizes the consequences of colonization because Demetrio is \u201cso far separated from his own heritage and identity that he does not even recognize it consciously\u201d (39). When Demetrio begins to forget his identity it results in \u201cpetty fighting, looting, and anarchy\u201d (34). Azuela emphasizes Demetrio's heritage so that readers understand what is at stake if cultural identity is lost.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1917 he moved to Mexico City where, for the rest of his life, he continued his writing, and worked as a doctor among the poor.\nIn 1942 he received the Mexican National Prize for Literature. On April 8, 1943 he became a founding member of Mexico's National College, where he gave lectures on Mexican, French, and Spanish novelists, and on his own literary experiences. In 1949 he received the Mexican National Prize for Arts and Sciences. He died in Mexico City March 1, 1952 and was placed in a sepulchre of the Pante\u00f3n Civil in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres.\n\n\n== 2015 Conference on Mariano Azuela and the Novel of the Mexican Revolution ==\nOn the anniversary year of his famous novel, The Underdogs, a conference was held in collaboration by the Chicano Studies departments of both California State University, Los Angeles and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It was held on May 15\u201316 at California State University, Los Angeles and contained speakers who were scholars of either Mariano Azuela or the works of the Mexican Revolution.\n\n\n== Partial list of works ==\n\n\n== Partial list of works translated into English ==\nThe Underdogs (1929).

        "article": "Miljenko Jergovi\u0107 (born 28 May 1966) is a prominent Bosnian writer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia to Croatian parents, Jergovi\u0107 received his M.A. in literature from the Sarajevo University. While at high-school, he started working as a journalist in printed and electronic media, as a contributor to literary and youth magazines, and was soon recognized as Croatia's media correspondent from Sarajevo.\n\n\n== Writing ==\nJergovi\u0107's novels treat his family members and their histories. He is also a journalist and has published a collection of his articles in Historijska \u010ditanka (A Reader in History, 1996).\nJergovi\u0107 writes a column in the Serbian daily Politika, for Vreme magazine and a regular column in the Croatian daily Jutarnji list entitled Sumnjivo lice (trans. \"suspicious character\", lit. \"suspicious face\").\n\n\n== Works ==\nHis novel Buick Riviera was made into a movie in 2008 by filmmaker Goran Ru\u0161inovi\u0107, and the two were in turn awarded the Golden Arena for Best Screenplay. According to the author himself, it is a \"novella\" set in North American countryside, dealing with the conflict of a Serbian refugee from Bosnia, probably a war criminal, and a Muslim refugee who had spent twenty years in the United States. Its heroes, who always carry with them their native lore, their religion and their mentality, though they have numerous reasons for feelings of love and understanding of others, become victims of their own inability to rise above their national background, above their old hatreds and the burden of historical conflicts.\nMiljenko Jergovic wrote another novel or \"documented diary\" \u2013 \"Volga, Volga\", a book about car and his driver. This is a complicated story about guilt and death, the Yugoslav war and internal conflicts. And as is Jergovic great storyteller, he starts with what the outside: Volga is not only black but glossy black like the piano.  Reading the book makes reader realize the main effect of storytelling: war destroys, stories are kept. Focal characteristics of the book are desire and strangeness, sadness and anger. Jergovi\u0107\u2019 car is a\"documentary fantasy\" and the story is about the generation living a lie.  Jergovi\u0107\u2019 Yugoslavia lost in dreams of acting, the desire for truth is opposed illusions and dreams, lies and legends. Jergovic the master of melancholy presents driving as a journey into the past, awakens memories of the companions, the times of sadness and loneliness. Central figure in the novel is Jalal Pljevljak, who is the experienced driver and a Muslim believer, whose faith prohibits the consumption of alcohol, drunk, and so risked disaster. Although the reader gets the key to a mysterious accident, second impression prevails much greater issue: the uncertainty about where the boundaries between fact, facts, legends, dreams and lies. The truth about things, it shows the contrasting perspectives of game storytelling, not just a matter of personal integrity and identity. Thus, the author briefly illuminates the history of the former Yugoslavia. As the scene of religious, ethnic and political relations and conflict former multinational federation determines the flow and actions, so, for example, accused Pljevljak, for example, both Croat and Muslim. At the end of the wars in the nineties it was very popular among intellectuals and yellow press to relativize the guilt of the pre-war crime and surrender it to forgetfulness. So, the case Pljevljak for a reader is a metaphor of the fate of the whole country.,\n\n\n== Literary circles ==\n\nA number of private conflicts in literary circles drew public attention to disagreement among famous writers. Namely, issues in the Croatian Writers' Society created fragmentation and an alleged unjust disqualification of writers on political grounds. Over the course of his career, Jergovi\u0107 was involved in these issues, as were many other noteworthy writers. In October 2002, Jergovi\u0107 was elected to the Croatian Writers' Society board of directors. In 2003, there was criticism that one of CWS founders, Velimir Viskovi\u0107, was judging CWS members on political grounds. This was revealed when Drago \u0160tambuk pointed out Viskovi\u0107's former association with the HDZ government. In April 2006, Jergovi\u0107 became involved in a literary dispute with Dra\u017een Katunari\u0107 over Jergovi\u0107's text on Houellebecqu, which Jergovi\u0107's considered charlatan for being based on the Qur'an.  Katunari\u0107 said that such texts with a Sarajevan and Islamic basis are not accepted in Zagreb. To which Jergovi\u0107 responded for him to put a gun to his head. This controversy encouraged Zdravko Zima to resign his membership in the Croatian Writers' Society because he felt the leadership wasn't distancing themselves from the attacks on Katunari\u0107. In April 2007, Jergovi\u0107 himself withdrew from CWS. Jergovi\u0107 said that the society contrasted his attitude to Croatian literature and literature in general. A number of other writers cut ties with the association in a similar fashion, including Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107 who resigned because he felt Velimir Viskovi\u0107's disqualification called for the real and symbolic dismissal of Jergovi\u0107 in 2011.In 2009, Viskovi\u0107 made public claims about Jergovi\u0107 reaffirming Chetniks in Serbia and setting out to market books for a Serbian market. Viskovi\u0107 made these claims in response to an interview Jergovi\u0107 gave. Some questioned whether the reason for the conflict with Jergovi\u0107 was Viskovi\u0107's life project \u2013 the Encyclopedia of Croatian Literature. When CWS members asked Viskovi\u0107 to apologize, he refused, citing years of insults to him, his family and other prominent writers.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn in Sarajevo in 1966, Jergovi\u0107 spent half of his life in his hometown. He even spent the first year of the Bosnian War, more precisely the Siege of Sarajevo there, before moving to Zagreb in 1993.\nJergovi\u0107 has been known as an avid supporter of Sarajevo football club FK \u017deljezni\u010dar, whose fan he has been since he was even a kid, even having a membership card of the club as well, renewing it in July 2019.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2012, he received the Angelus Central European Literature Award for his book Srda pjeva, u sumrak, na Duhove (\"Srda Sings at Dusk On Pentecost\") and in 2018 he won the Georg Dehio Book Prize.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nOpservatorija Var\u0161ava, poem collection, 1988\nU\u010di li no\u0107as neko u ovom gradu japanski?, poem collection, 1992\nHimmel Comando, 1992\nSarajevski Marlboro, short stories, 1994\nEnglish-language edition, Sarajevo Marlboro, translated by Stela Tomasevic.

        "article": "Ferdinand L\u00e9opold Oyono (14 September 1929 \u2013 10 June 2010) was a diplomat, politician and author from Cameroon.\nHis literary work is recognised for a sense of irony that reveals how easily people can be fooled. Writing in French in the 1950s, Oyono had only a brief literary career, but his anti-colonialist novels are considered classics of 20th century African literature; his first novel, Une vie de boy\u2014published in 1956 and later translated as Houseboy\u2014is considered particularly important.\nBeginning in the 1960s, Oyono had a long career of service as a diplomat and as a minister in the government of Cameroon. As one of President Paul Biya's top associates, he ultimately served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 to 1997 and then as Minister of State for Culture from 1997 to 2007. He was also Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978.\n\n\n== Diplomatic and political career ==\nOyono was born near Ebolowa in the South Province of Cameroon. After obtaining his secondary education in Yaound\u00e9, Oyono studied in Paris. Following Cameroon's independence, Oyono was a member of the Cameroonian delegation to the United Nations in 1960, when the country was admitted to the UN. Oyono subsequently served as Cameroon's ambassador to various countries from 1965 to 1974. He was briefly the Ambassador to Liberia in 1965, then served as ambassador to the Benelux countries and the European Communities from 1965 to 1968 and as ambassador to France, with additional accreditation for Spain, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, from 1969 to 1974. From 1974 to 1982 he was Cameroon's Permanent Representative to the United Nations; he acted as President of the United Nations Security Council in place of the United Kingdom's Ivor Richard at the 1,866th meeting of the Security Council on 16 December 1975, and was Chairman of UNICEF from 1977 to 1978. From 1982 to 1985 he again served as ambassador to various countries: first as ambassador to Algeria and Libya, then as ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries.In 1985, President Paul Biya recalled Oyono from London and appointed him as Secretary-General of the Presidency of Cameroon. Oyono remained in the post for about a year before Biya instead appointed him as Minister of Town Planning and Housing in 1986. The post of Secretary-General of the Presidency was historically very powerful, but Oyono's stint in the office was associated with a weakening of it under President Biya; significantly, Oyono was moved from the Secretariat-General to an ordinary ministry\u2014effectively a demotion. Although Oyono was dismissed from the government in 1990, he was subsequently appointed as Minister of Foreign Relations on 27 November 1992, serving in that position until he was instead named Minister of State for Culture on 8 December 1997. Oyono was a member of the National Commission for the co-ordination of President Biya's re-election campaign in the October 2004 presidential election and was the president of the campaign's support and follow-up committee in the South Province.After nearly ten years as Minister of State for Culture, Oyono was dismissed from the government on 7 September 2007. Oyono was thought to be a close friend of Paul Biya, and observers attributed his departure from the government to his advanced age and poor health. He had been criticised for reportedly not working at his ministry for months at a time. After leaving the government, Oyono was thought to retain a great deal of influence as \"an unofficial adviser\" to Biya. Biya appointed him as a roving ambassador on 30 June 2009.As the representative of President Biya, Oyono attended a play commemorating Cameroon's independence struggle and the country's subsequent reunification on 14 May 2010; the play was part of festivities marking Cameroon's 50th year of independence from France.During a visit to Cameroon by Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the 80-year-old Oyono died suddenly in Yaound\u00e9 on 10 June 2010. Reportedly Oyono fell ill at the presidential palace after a reception for the Secretary-General; he received immediate medical attention and an ambulance was called, but he quickly died. Later in the day, President Biya released a statement expressing sadness regarding Oyono's death, although the statement gave no details. Secretary-General Ban, meanwhile, expressed sadness during a speech to the National Assembly of Cameroon.An official funeral was held for Oyono with a series of events beginning on 24 June 2010 and concluding with his burial at Ngoazip, near Ebolowa, on 26 June.\n\n\n== Novels ==\nOyono's novels were written in French in the late 1950s and were only translated into English a decade or two afterward.\nAmong his works are: \n\nUne vie de boy (Paris, 1956; translated as Houseboy in 1966), a diary-form novel that criticised the morality of colonialism\nLe Vieux N\u00e8gre et la m\u00e9daille (Paris, 1956; translated as The Old Man and the Medal in 1969)\nChemin d'Europe (1960; translated as Road to Europe in 1989)\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Driss Chra\u00efbi (July 15, 1926 \u2013 April 1, 2007) was a Moroccan author whose novels deal with colonialism, culture clashes, generational conflict and the treatment of women and are often perceived as semi-autobiographical.Born in El Jadida and educated in Casablanca, Chra\u00efbi went to Paris in 1945 to study chemistry before turning to literature and journalism.\n\n\n== Life ==\nDriss Chra\u00efbi was born to a merchant family in French Morocco but was later raised in Casablanca. He attended the Koranic school before joining the M'hammed Guessous School in Rabat, followed by the Lyc\u00e9e Lyautey in Casablanca. In 1945 he went to university in Paris, where, in 1950, he earned a degree in chemical engineering. After obtaining his degree, he abandoned science before the doctorate. Instead, he earned his living from a string of odd jobs, before turning to literature and journalism. He produced programmes for France Culture, frequented poets, taught Maghrebian literature at Laval University in Quebec and devoted himself to writing. In 1955, he married Catherine Birckel, with whom he had five children. In 1978, he remarried with Sheena McCallion, a Scotswoman, with whom he also had five children.\nHe became known through his first two novels, Le pass\u00e9 simple (1954), whose depiction of a young man's revolt against traditional society generated controversy in Morocco during its struggle for independence, and its counterpoint Les boucs (1955) a ferocious attack on the treatment of North African immigrants in France.\nA page turns with the death of his father in 1957. The writer, in exile in France, went beyond the revolt against his father and established a new dialogue with him beyond the grave in Succession ouverte ( 1962), translated as Heirs to the Past. Ten years later, La Civilisation, ma M\u00e8re!... (1972) gave a more lighthearted, fictionalised account of a Moroccan father's changing relationship with his wife and, more broadly, questioned the place of women in Moroccan society, offering renewed hope through the mother's evolution. \nHe died in Dr\u00f4me, France., where he had lived since 1988, and was buried in the Shuhada Cemetery, Casablanca, Morocco, near his father's grave, thus fulfilling his last wishes. He took with him to the hereafter the secret of the last book he was working on.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nHe was awarded the Prix de l\u2019Afrique M\u00e9diterran\u00e9enne in 1973, the Franco-Arab Friendship Award in 1981. and the Mondello prize for the translation of Naissance \u00e0 l'aube in Italy. Ref : https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2007/04/04/driss-chraibi-ecrivain-marocain_891743_3382.html\n\n\n== Works ==\nHis first novel, Le pass\u00e9 simple was published in 1954. Its English translation by Hugh Harter The Simple Past, was reissued in 2020 by NYRB Classics, with an introduction by Adam Shatz.\nOther works by Driss Chra\u00efbi:\n\nThe Butts (1955) - Les Boucs (1955; The Butts), translated by Hugh A. Harter, shifted the author\u2019s accusatory finger from a paternalistic Islamic formalism to the oppressed condition of many North Africans living in France.\nFrom All Horizons (1958). Title in French : De tous les horizons.\nThe Donkey (1956) L'\u00e2ne, and The Crowd (1961) La Foule; both confront the inadequacies of the newly independent Third World countries, as well as the failings of European civilization.\nHeirs to the Past (1962) Original title: Succession ouverte. The English translation by Len Ortzen was published by Heinemann in 1972.\nA Friend Is Coming to See You (1967). The weaknesses of Western values appear most noticeably in Un Ami viendra vous voir (1967; \u201c\u201d), in which Chra\u00efbi combines the themes of insanity, violence, and the oppression of women.\nMother Comes of Age (1972). Original title in French : La Civilisation, ma M\u00e8re!.... Translated into English by Hugh Harter.\nMort au Canada (1975). \"Death in Canada\"\nFlutes of Death (1981) Original title : Une enqu\u00eate au pays.

        "article": "Antonio di Benedetto (2 November 1922 in Mendoza \u2013 10 October 1986 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine novelist, short-story writer and columnist.\n\n\n== Publishing career ==\nDi Benedetto began writing and publishing stories in his teens, inspired by the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky and Luigi Pirandello. Mundo Animal, appearing in 1952, was his first story collection and won prestigious awards. A revised version came out in 1971, but the Xenos Books translation uses the first edition to catch the youthful flavor.\nAntonio di Benedetto wrote five novels, the most famous being the existential masterpiece Zama (1956). El Silenciero (The Silencer, 1964) is noteworthy for expressing his intense abhorrence of noise. Critics have compared his works to Alain Robbe-Grillet, Julio Cort\u00e1zar and Ernesto S\u00e1bato.\nIn 1976, during the military dictatorship of General Videla, di Benedetto was imprisoned and tortured. Released a year later, he went into exile in Spain, then returned home in 1984. He travelled widely and won numerous awards, but never acquired the worldwide fame of other Latin American writers, perhaps because his work was not translated to many languages.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMundo animal (Animal World).  1952.

        "article": "Thomas Mokopu Mofolo (22 December 1876 \u2013 8 September 1948) is considered the greatest Basotho author. He wrote mostly in the Sesotho language, but his most popular book, Chaka, has been translated into English and other languages.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThomas Mofolo was born in Khojane, Lesotho, on 22 December 1876. He was educated in the local schools of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society and obtained a teacher's certificate in 1898. While he was working at the book depot in Morija, some of the missionaries encouraged him to write what was to become the first novel in Southern Sotho, Moeti oa bochabela (1907; The Traveler of the East). The edifying story of a young Sotho chieftain's conversion to Christianity, it is cleverly interwoven with traditional myths and praise poems. Its success prompted other young teachers to try their hand at fiction writing, thus launching one of the earliest literary movements in sub-Saharan Africa.\nMofolo's next book, Pitseng (1910), is built on a rather clumsy love plot in imitation of European fiction. It contains perceptive descriptions of native mores in Lesotho and in South Africa and a thoughtful, by no means encomiastic, appraisal of the influence of Christianity on traditional marriage customs.\nMofolo then composed Chaka (1925), a fictionalized account of the Zulu conqueror who built a mighty empire during the first quarter of the 19th century. Under Mofolo's pen, the eventful career of Chaka (Shaka) becomes the epic tragedy of a heroic figure whose overweening ambition drives him to insane cruelty and ultimate ruin. The earliest major contribution of black Africa to the corpus of modern world literature, Chaka is a genuine masterpiece; the narrative follows the austere curve of growth and decline which controls the structure of classic tragedy at its best; psychological motivation is sharply clarified at all points; and the author has cleverly manipulated the supernatural element, which is endowed with true symbolic value.\nAlthough the missionaries were sensitive to the high literary quality of Chaka, the pictures of pre-Christian life that the book contains made them reluctant to publish it. In his disappointment, Mofolo left for South Africa in 1910 and gave up writing. For several years he was a labour agent, recruiting workers for the gold mines of Transvaal and the plantations of Natal. After 1927 he bought a store in Lesotho; in 1937 he acquired a farm in South Africa but was evicted under the Bantu Land Act. In 1940, a broken and sick man, he returned to Lesotho, where he died on 8 September 1948.\n\n\n== Recognition and legacy ==\nThe library at the National University of Lesotho is named the Thomas Mofolo Library in his honour.\nIn 1976, the inaugural Mofolo-Plomer Prize, created by Nadine Gordimer and so named in honour of Mofolo and South African writer William Plomer, was awarded to Mbulelo Mzamane. The judges for that year were Chinua Achebe, Alan Paton and Adam Small. Achmat Dangor, JM Coetzee (1977), Njabulo Simakahle Ndebele, Rose Zwi (1982) and Peter Wilhelm have been other recipients of the prize. \nThe Thomas Mofolo Prize for Outstanding Sesotho Fiction was launched in South Africa on 6 February 2019, to be awarded in December.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFrom the collection of the Library of Congress, Washington, DC:\n\nChaka (1939)\nChaka, a historical romance, with an introduction by Sir Henry Newbolt ... translated from the original Sesuto by F.

        "article": "Juan Mar\u00eda Montalvo y Fiallos (13 April 1832 in Ambato \u2013 17 January 1889 in Paris) was an Ecuadorian author and essayist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHis grandfather, Jos\u00e9 Santos Montalvo, born in Andaluc\u00eda, migrated to Am\u00e9rica and after some years working as a cinchona bark gatherer across Panam\u00e1, Venezuela and Colombia, he arrived at Ecuador where he worked as a seller of fabrics. In Guano, Ecuador, he meets Jacinta Oviedo, whom he married and had many children, one of them was Marcos, father of Juan Montalvo, who worked also as a traveller fabrics seller.In one of Marcos' business trips, he arrives at Quinchicoto, a small town near Ambato, where he meets Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Fiallos and with whom he marries in the church \"La Matriz\" in Ambato, January 1, 1811. \nBorn in Ambato to Jos\u00e9 marcos Montalvo and Josefa Fiallos, he studied philosophy and law in Quito before returning to his hometown in 1854. He held diplomatic posts in Italy and France from 1857 to 1859. A political liberal, Montalvo's beliefs were marked by anti-clericalism and a keen hatred for the two caudillos that ruled Ecuador during his life: Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno and Ignacio de Veintemilla. After an issue of El Cosmopolita viciously attacked Moreno, Montalvo was exiled to Colombia for seven years. Moreno's assassination was attributed to Montalvo's writings. He was a dedicated champion of democracy and an enemy of the writer Juan Le\u00f3n Mera.\nIn the late seventies Juan Montalvo was twice exiled to France, remaining there from 1879, as punishment for Las catilinarias (1880), the work that made him famous throughout intellectual circles in the United States, Europe and the rest of Latin America. Alongside full-length books, Montalvo was an accomplished essayist, and his Siete Tratados (1882) and Geometr\u00eda Moral (published in 1902, after his death) were popular in Ecuador and were banned by Veintemilla.\nHe also wrote a sequel to Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote, called Cap\u00edtulos que se le Olvidaron a Cervantes (\"Chapters Cervantes Forgot\"), published posthumously in 1895. He died of tuberculosis in Paris.  His mummified body now rests in a mausoleum in his birthplace of Ambato.\n\n\n== Family ==\nJuan Montalvo's father was Marco Montalvo Oviedo of Guano, and his mother was Mar\u00eda Josefa Fiallos y Villacreces of Ambato. Montalvo was the youngest of 7 siblings: Francisco, Francisco Javier, Mariano, Alegr\u00eda, Rosa, Juana and Isabel. Montalvo married Mar\u00eda Guzm\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez in Ambato on 17 October 1868 and had two children with her. In 1882 he met Augustine Contoux with whom he had one child.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMontalvo's likeness appears on the Ecuadorian five-centavo coin.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nLas catilinarias (1880)\nCap\u00edtulos que se le olvidaron a Cervantes (1868) - Montalvo's only novel\nLibro de las pasiones (published posthumously in 1935) contains the dramas La Leprosa, Jara, Granja, El Descomulgado and El Dictador\nSiete Tratados (1882)\nGeometr\u00eda Moral (published posthumously in 1902)\nJudas (1872)\n\n\n=== Literary and political magazines founded by Montalvo ===\nLa Raz\u00f3n (1848)\nEl Veterano (1849)\nLa Moral evang\u00e9lica (1854)\nEl Espectador (1855)\nEl Cosmopolita (1865)\nEl Regenerador (1872)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPareja Diezcanseco, Alfredo (1989), Entry: \"Juan Montalvo (1832-1889)\"; In: Sol\u00e9, Carlos A.

        "article": "R\u00f3mulo \u00c1ngel del Monte Carmelo Gallegos Freire (2 August 1884 \u2013 5 April 1969) was a Venezuelan novelist and politician. For a period of nine months during 1948, he governed as the first freely elected president in Venezuela's history. He was removed from power by military officers in the 1948 Venezuelan coup.R\u00f3mulo Gallegos is considered the most relevant Venezuelan novelist of the 20th century, and a prominent figure in Latin American literature.\n\n\n== Early life and writings ==\nR\u00f3mulo Gallegos was born in Caracas to R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Os\u00edo and Rita Freire Guruceaga, into a family of humble origin. He began his work as a schoolteacher, writer, classical music enthusiast, and journalist in 1903. His novel Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara was first published in 1929, and it was because of the book's criticisms of the regime of longtime dictator Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez that he was forced to flee the country. He took refuge in Spain, where he continued to write: his acclaimed novels Cantaclaro (1934) and Canaima (1935) date from this period.\nHe returned to Venezuela in 1936 and was appointed Minister of Public Education.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1937 he was elected to Congress and, in 1940\u201341, served as Mayor of Caracas. In 1945, R\u00f3mulo Gallegos was involved in the coup d'\u00e9tat that brought R\u00f3mulo Betancourt and the \"Revolutionary Government Junta\" to power, in the period known as El Trienio Adeco. In the 1947 general election he ran for the presidency of the republic as the Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica candidate and won in what is generally believed to be the country's first honest election. He took over 74 percent of the vote, still a record for a free election in Venezuela.  He took office on February 15, and was noted for raising the state's tax revenue for oil profits increase from 43% to 50%, a tax scheme known as \"fifty / fifty\" and which was subsequently replicated in several oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, army officers Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez and Luis Felipe Llovera P\u00e1ez, threw him out of power November in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat. He took refuge first in Cuba and then in Mexico. Gallegos returned to his country after the fall of the dictatorship of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez in 1958. While he was named a senator for life, he no longer took an active role in politics.\nGallegos was awarded the National Literature Prize (1958, for La doncella), and elected to the Venezuelan Academy of the Language (the correspondent agency in Venezuela of the Spanish Royal Academy).From 1960 to 1963, he was a Commissioner of the newly created Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (created by OAS in Washington on 18 August 1959), and he was also its first President (1960)  a position he held until 1963.\n\n\n=== Administration ===\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nHe was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1960, largely due to the efforts of Miguel Otero Silva, and gained widespread support in Latin America, but ultimately lost out to Saint-John Perse. The R\u00f3mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize was created in his honor on 6 August 1964 by a presidential decree, enacted by Venezuelan president Ra\u00fal Leoni. The declared purpose of the prize is to \"perpetuate and honor the work of the eminent novelist and also to stimulate the creative activity of Spanish language writers.\" It is awarded by the government of Venezuela, through the offices of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Center for Latin American Studies (Celarg). The first prize was given in 1967. It was awarded every five years until 1987, when it became a biannual award. The award includes a cash prize of \u20ac100,000 making it among the richest literary prizes in the world.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nGallegos was married to Teotiste Arocha Egui, who served as First Lady of Venezuela in 1948. R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Freire died in Caracas on 5 April 1969.\n\nIn 2016 his grave was desecrated by thieves, who stole the marble and his remains. His granddaughter took Twitter to express her frustration: \"Here in Venezuela, not even the remains of an ex-president can be kept away from the hands of crime.\"\n\n\n== Published works ==\nEl \u00faltimo Solar (1920) (alternative title:Reinaldo Solar)\nLa trepadora (1925)\nDo\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara (1929)\nCantaclaro (1934)\nCanaima (1935) (also published in English, 1988 ISBN 0-8061-2119-X)\nPobre negro (1937)\nEl forastero (1942)\nSobre la misma tierra (1943)\nLa rebeli\u00f3n (1946)\nLa brizna de paja en el viento (1952)\nUna posici\u00f3n en la vida (1954)\nEl \u00faltimo patriota (1957)\nEl piano viejo\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nPresidents of Venezuela\nList of Venezuelans\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGallegos: Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara / Donald Leslie Shaw., 1972\nR\u00f3mulo Gallegos: an Oklahoma encounter and the writing of the last novel / Lowell Dunham., 1974\nNine essays on R\u00f3mulo Gallegos / Hugo Rodr\u00edguez-Alcal\u00e1., 1979\nThree Spanish American novelists a European view / Cyril A Jones., 1967\nSociopolitical aspects of the novels of R\u00f3mulo Gallegos / Earl Leon Cardon., 1962\nThe function of symbol in the novels of R\u00f3mulo Gallegos / Jeannine Elizabeth Hyde., 1964\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDUNHAM, LOWELL. 1990: \"Cartas familiares de R\u00f3mulo Gallegos\".

        "article": "Karl Edward Wagner (12 December 1945 \u2013 14 October 1994) was an American writer, poet, editor, and publisher of horror, science fiction, and heroic fantasy, who was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and originally trained as a psychiatrist. He wrote numerous dark fantasy and horror stories. As an editor, he created a three-volume set of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian fiction restored to its original form as written, and edited the long-running and genre-defining The Year's Best Horror Stories series for DAW Books. His Carcosa publishing company issued four volumes of the best stories by some of the major authors of the so-called Golden Age pulp magazines. He is possibly best known for his creation of a series of stories featuring the character Kane, the Mystic Swordsman.\nHis disillusionment with the medical profession can be detected in the stories \"The Fourth Seal\" and \"Into Whose Hands\". He described his personal philosophy as nihilistic, anarchistic and absurdist, and claimed, not entirely seriously, to be related to \"an opera composer named \"Richard\". Wagner also admired the cinema of Sam Peckinpah, stating \"I worship the film The Wild Bunch\".\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWagner was the fourth and youngest child of Aubrey J. Wagner and Dorothea Huber. His father was an official of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Wagner earned a history degree from Kenyon College in 1967, and a psychiatry degree from University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. As noted above, he disliked the medical profession, which he abandoned upon establishing himself as a writer.Wagner was productive as both a writer and editor/anthologist; see below. His friends included the writer Manly Wade Wellman, two of whose collections he published with the Carcosa publishing imprint.\nWagner died in his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on October 14, 1994, essentially due to the consequences of longterm alcoholism. It was reported in a late 1994 issue of the Newsletter of the Horror Writers of America that Wagner's causes of death were heart failure and liver failure.Exorcisms and Ecstasies,  a posthumous volume of uncollected stories, miscellany, and tributes was published by small press publisher Fedogan & Bremer in 1997. Night Shade Books has published the complete Kane stories (novels and shorts) in two hardcover volumes.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nSome of Wagner's work is set in Robert E. Howard's universe (featuring Conan the Barbarian and Bran Mak Morn); he also edited three volumes of Howard's original Conan tales, important to purists for being the first to restore the texts to their originally published forms. His three volumes of Echoes of Valor also featured restored versions of pulp-era fantasy stories by authors such as Fritz Leiber, C. L. Moore, Henry Kuttner, and Nictzin Dyalhis. Wagner wrote an unpublished Bran Mak Morn novel, Queen of the Night, which was originally scheduled to be published by Zebra books during 1978 and Ace Books during 1980.  [Refer to David Drake's Newsletter #105 in which he states 'Queen of the Night' was never written.]\n\n\n=== Kane, the Mystic Swordsman ===\nWagner created his own mystical and immortal pre-historical anti-hero, Kane, whose name and background are based on traditional conceptions of the biblical Cain. A powerful, left-handed warrior-sorcerer with red hair and blue eyes, the character was described by Wagner as one \"who could master any situation intellectually, or rip heads off if push came to shove\". Kane is an immortal, somewhat like the Wandering Jew (or more specifically, Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer, a novel which Wagner cites as a major influence in his essay \"The Once and Future Kane\"). Kane's character also includes elements of Robert E. Howard's Solomon Kane. He is an immortal, cursed to wander the Earth until he is destroyed by the violence that he himself has created. He sells his loyalty as a fighter to the highest bidder. He is a well-read and intelligent man who has traveled the world for centuries and is able to discuss music, poetry, politics, and many other subjects. He is also amoral and a born killer. The Kane stories are often classified as tales of sword and sorcery (although Wagner disliked the term), which some critics have compared favorably to those of Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock. In his story \"The Gothic Touch\", Kane actually encounters Moorcock's albino anti-hero Elric. The character Kane is considered one of the most memorable and original anti-heroes of heroic fantasy.Inspired by the sword and sorcery adventures of Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Robert E. Howard's mighty-thewed barbarian Conan the Cimmerian, Wagner set about creating his own fantasy character while still attending medical school. The result was initially published as a 1970 paperback original with a lurid cover by West Coast pornography publisher Powell Publications. The novel's text was altered by an unknown copy editor to conform with the cover art.\nAfter publishing a pseudonymous pornographic novel with a small New York company, Wagner relinquished his chance to become a doctor and instead decided to write full-time. During 1973, Warner Paperback library published  Death Angel's Shadow, which collected the three original Kane tales (one novella, one novelette, and one short story). He also began selling his stories and poems regularly to the growing small press magazine market. Several of his tales were published in Gary Hoppenstand's Midnight Sunn, a magazine initially devoted to Kane and the new school of epic fantasy writers. This was followed by publication of the first Kane novel, Bloodstone, during 1975. Warner Books commissioned a cover painting by Frank Frazetta (who had helped revive the Conan franchise, and who would paint a number of future covers for the series) and Wagner's writing career improved.After a novel featuring Howard's Pictish hero Bran Mak Morn, Wagner's next Kane book was Dark Crusade (1976). A Kane story published elsewhere, \"Two Suns Setting\", won the 1977 British Fantasy Award and was also a World Fantasy Award nominee. Wagner published other Kane stories in magazines such as Chacal, Whispers and Escape! during 1977. Gerald W. Page, then editor of DAW Books Year's Best Fantasy and Horror Stories, began to reprint Kane tales in the anthology series Night Winds; a collection of six previously published Kane tales followed (Warner Books, 1978). The publisher also reissued all previous Kane books including a new edition of Darkness Weaves, which reinstated the author's preferred text.\nThe Book of Kane was the last published volume of Kane material (1985) until Night Shade Books' omnibus editions of novels and shorter tales.\nA proposed fourth Kane novel, In the Wake of the Night, was never completed, although an excerpt was published as part of a World Fantasy Convention souvenir book of 1981; this also appears in the collection Midnight Sun (2003).In 2004, it was reported that movie producer Lauren Moews had \"acquired Death Angel's Shadow, and will produce a film based upon \"Reflections for the Winter of My Soul,\" the first of three short stories comprising Death Angel's Shadow. The other two short stories, \"Cold Light\" and \"Mirage,\" are waiting in the wings to be developed into a possible KANE franchise for Tonic Films\".  [1] As of 2020 the film had not entered production.\n\n\n=== Other writings ===\nBesides the Kane books, Wagner wrote contemporary horror stories (some of which, like \"At First Just Ghostly\", also feature Kane). These were collected in the books In a Lonely Place (1983), Why Not You and I? (1987) and the posthumous Exorcisms and Ecstasies (1997). They range from the very literate and allusive (such as \"The River of Night's Dreaming\", which refers to Richard O'Brien's The Rocky Horror Show and the myth of Carcosa used in the work of Ambrose Bierce and Robert W. Chambers), to the pulpy and parodic (such as \"Plan Ten from Inner Space\", a crazed homage to Ed Wood's magnum opus Plan 9 from Outer Space). His later stories, such as \"But You'll Never Follow Me\" and \"Silted In\", were described by Ramsey Campbell as tormented and deeply personal; some deal explicitly with drug addiction (e.g. \"More Sinned Against\") and sexual subjects, including psychological repression (e.g. \"Brushed Away\") and transsexualism (e.g. \"Lacunae\").\nDuring 1983 Wagner won the World Fantasy Award for his horror novella \"Beyond Any Measure\" and the British Fantasy Award during 1984 for \"Neither Brute Nor Human\".\nWith his friends Jim Groce and David Drake, who were concerned that Arkham House would cease publication after the death of its founder, August Derleth, Wagner formed the Carcosa publishing house in North Carolina during 1973 to preserve the work of their favorite pulp magazine horror writers in hardcovers. Carcosa Press published four substantial volumes of horror tales: Murgunstrumm and Others by Hugh B. Cave, Far Lands, Other Days by E. Hoffmann Price, Worse Things Waiting and Lonely Vigils, both by Manly Wade Wellman. All books were edited by Wagner and illustrated profusely. A fifth collection was planned, Death Stalks the Night, by Hugh B. Cave; Lee Brown Coye was working on illustrating it when he died, causing Carcosa to abandon the project. The book was eventually published by Fedogan & Bremer.  Wagner later acted as the literary agent for Manly Wade Wellman's estate.\nWagner collaborated with Drake on Killer, a science fiction horror novel set during the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian.\nThe illustrator of Murgunstrumm and Worse Things Waiting was the noted Weird Tales artist Lee Brown Coye. Coye's macabre designs, incorporating mysterious lattices of twigs, were the inspiration for Wagner's British Fantasy Award-winning story \"Sticks\". The story was later included in a revised edition of Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos.\nA connoisseur of rare horror stories, Wagner perspicaciously edited many horror and fantasy anthologies; perhaps his greatest achievement of this topic was the annual anthology series The Year's Best Horror Stories (DAW Books), which he edited for fourteen years from volume VIII (1980) until volume XXII (1994). The series was canceled after Wagner's death. However, while the original editions were paperback originals, Underwood-Miller preserved the series in a set of three limited-edition hardcovers.\nWagner was a frequent visitor to London to attend fantasy and horror conventions. Though he continued to edit, producing three volumes of the heroic fantasy anthology Echoes of Valor for Tor Books during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and published a steady sequence of short stories (most of which were apparently written some years earlier), his most productive time was finished. In the story \"The Gothic Touch\", Kane teams up with the albino warrior-sorcerer Elric in a tribute anthology honoring the fiction of Michael Moorcock (Tales of the White Wolf).\nWagner wrote several unproduced screenplays and treatments including a film script for Conan III for movie producer Dino De Laurentiis and a TV script based on Robert E. Howards \"The Horror on the Mound\" (for Tales from the Darkside).Wagner provided the foreword to \"Fat Face\", a Cthulhu Mythos tale by Michael Shea published as a standalone book by Axolotl Press, 1987.\n\n\n=== Audio, television and comics adaptations ===\n\n\n==== Audio ====\nSeveral Wagner works were adapted for audio cassette readings, including:\n\n\"Sticks\" Adapted by Meatball Fulton, as part of the radio series The Cabinet of Dr. Fritz. Directed by Bill Raymond. Fort Edward, NY: ZBS Foundation, 1984. (A dramatic reading of Wagner's story plus two stories by Craig Strete).

Santa Fe, NM: Sunset Productions, 1993.\nRaven's Eyrie. A Kane story on two audio cassettes; narrated by Roger Zelazny. Santa Fe, NM: Sunset Productions, 1993.\n\n\n==== Television ====\n\"The River of Night's Dreaming\" was adapted for the TV series The Hunger during 1998.Sticks provided the inspiration for the lattice type structures used in the television series True Detective.\n\n\n==== Graphic novels ====\nWagner was involved with several comics ventures. His Kane story \"In the Lair of Yslsl\" (which was later incorporated into the Kane novel Dark Crusade) was adapted by Bill Whitcomb and Steve Vance, and illustrated by Vance, Wes Smith, and Bill Black for the graphic medium in Dark Phantasms 1, Summer 1976. During 1993 Wagner co-wrote the graphic novel Tell Me Dark with John Ney Reiber and Kent Williams, contributing original characters and situations. It was published by DC Comics in both hardcover and trade paperback.At the time of his death, he had just finished compiling Exorcisms and Ecstasies, and had started working on two novels, The Fourth Seal and Tell Me, Dark, the latter based on the graphic novel he disowned.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nIn a Lonely Place (1983).\nWhy Not You and I?

        "article": "Tomislav Ladan (25 June 1932 \u2013 12 September 2008) was a Croatian essayist, critic, translator and novelist.\nLadan was born in Ivanjica, Serbia, and spent his formative years in his native Bosnia and Herzegovina (Travnik, Bugojno), where he graduated from the Philosophical Faculty at Sarajevo. Since he couldn't get permanent employment in the then Serbs-dominated Bosnian cultural life because of his sometimes ostentatious Croatian identity, Ladan worked intermittently as a private tutor, translator and journalist \u2014 until the Croatian doyen of belles letters, Miroslav Krle\u017ea, found him a job at the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute in Zagreb. Ladan was the director of the same institute and the editor-in-chief of an eight-language parallel dictionary.\nLadan wrote several books of essays that cover diverse fields such as cursing in Croatian, voluminous polygraphy playing with etymological meanings of the words that define human culture, from God to globalization (Rije\u010di, \"Words\"), and nuances of medieval spiritual culture (Parva medievalia).\nLadan's only novel, Bosanski grb (\"Bosnian coat of arms\") (1975) is a postmodernist fiction written as a combination of Rabelaisian linguistic feast and a treatise on the historical destiny of Croats in central Bosnia.\nAs a critic over more than four decades, Ladan surveyed virtually all works written in Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian \u2014 not infrequently to the consternation of the \"objects\" of his criticism. Follower of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and Frank Kermode, Ladan didn't pay much attention to the deconstructionists (Derrida) or Foucault, both of whom he found arid and sterile. His best critical essays also evaluate such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Musil.\nLadan was also a noted translator from Greek, Latin, English, German, Swedish and Norwegian.\n\n\n== References ==\nU spomen, Tomislav Ladan (in Croatian)\n\n\n== External links ==\nUmro Tomislav Ladan (in Croatian)"

Born to an ethnic German and Slovak family, \u0160enoa became a key figure in the development of an independent literary tradition in Croatian and shaping the emergence of the urban Croatian identity of Zagreb and its surroundings at a time when Austrian control was weaning. He was a literary transitional figure, who helped bring Croatian literature from Romanticism to Realism and introduced the historical novel to Croatia. He wrote more than ten novels, among which the most notable are: Zlatarovo zlato (The Goldsmith's Treasure; 1871), \u010cuvaj se senjske ruke (Pirates of Senj; 1876), Selja\u010dka buna (Peasants' revolt; 1877), and Diogenes (1878).\n\u0160enoa was one of the most popular Croatian novelists at the time, and the author of the popular patriotic song \"\u017divila Hrvatska\".\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nHe was born in Zagreb, then part of the Habsburg Empire, into a family of Slovak-German origin. His surname was originally spelled Sch\u00f6noa. His father was Alois Sch\u00f6noa, and mother was Terezija Rabacs, a Slovak woman from Budapest. He studied law in Prague. He also lived in Vienna for a while, but returned to Zagreb in 1866. He died in Zagreb at the age of 43.\nFrom 1874 to 1881, he edited the literary journal Vijenac (\"Wreath\").\nHe died from disease picked up after the 1880 Zagreb earthquake.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn his novels, he fused national romanticism characterized by buoyant and inventive language with realistic depictions of the growth of the petite bourgeois class.\nThis \"father of the Croatian novel\" (and modern national literature) is known for his mass Cecildemillean scenes and poetic description of oppressed Croatian peasantry and nobility struggling against foreign rule (Venetians, Austrians/Germans and Hungarians) and romanticised period from the 15th to the 18th century. It has become a commonplace phrase that \"\u0160enoa created the Croatian reading public\", especially by writing in a popular style.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2008, a total of 182 streets in Croatia were named after August \u0160enoa, making him the person with the seventh most streets in the country named after him.\u0160enoa's birth house is located at 27 Ivo Mallin House. It is open to visitors. The house suffered damage in the 2020 Zagreb earthquake, but was later reopened.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"\u0160enoa, August\".
