        "article": "Wessel Johannes \"Hansie\" Cronje (25 September 1969 \u2013 1 June 2002) was a South African international cricketer and captain of the South African national cricket team in the 1990s. He was voted the 11th greatest South African in 2004 despite having been banned from cricket for life due to his role in a match-fixing scandal. He died in a plane crash in 2002.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCronje was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa to Ewie Cronje and San-Marie Cronje on 25 September 1969. He graduated in 1987 from Grey College in Bloemfontein, where he was the head boy. An excellent all round sportsman, he represented the then Orange Free State Province in cricket and rugby at schools level. He was the captain of his school's cricket and rugby teams. Cronje earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of the Free State. He had an older brother, Frans Cronje, and a younger sister, Hester Parsons.\nHis father Ewie had played for Orange Free State in the 1960s, and Frans had also played first-class cricket.\n\n\n== First-class career ==\nCronje made his first-class debut for Orange Free State against Transvaal at Johannesburg in January 1988 at the age of 18. In the following season, he was a regular, appearing in all eight Currie Cup matches plus being part of the Benson and Hedges Series winning team, scoring 73 as an opener in the final. In 1989\u201390, despite playing all the Currie Cup matches, he failed to make a century, and averaged only 19.76; however, in one-day games he averaged 60.12. During that season he scored his maiden century for South African Universities against Mike Gatting's rebels.Despite having just turned 21, Cronje was made captain of Orange Free State for the 1990\u201391 season. He scored his maiden century for them against Natal in December 1990, and finished the season with another century and a total of 715 runs at 39.72. That season he also scored 159* in a 40-over match against Griqualand West.\nIn 1992\u201393, he captained Orange Free State to the Castle Cup/Total Power Series double.\nIn 1995, Cronje appeared for Leicestershire where he scored 1301 runs at 52.04 finishing the season as the county's leading scorer.\nIn 1995\u201396, he finished the season top of the batting averages in the Currie Cup, his top score of 158 helped Free State chase down 389 to beat Northern Transvaal.In 1997, Cronje played for Ireland as an overseas player in the Benson and Hedges Cup and helped them to a 46-run win over Middlesex by scoring 94 not out and taking three wickets. This was Ireland's first ever win against English county opposition. Later in the same competition, he scored 85 and took one wicket against Glamorgan.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Debuts ===\nCronje's form in 1991/92 was impressive especially in the one-day format where he averaged 61.40. He earned an international call up for the 1992 World Cup, making his One Day International debut against Australia at Sydney. During the tournament he played in eight of the team's nine games, averaging 34.00 with the bat, while his medium pace was used in bowling 20 overs.\nAfter the World Cup Cronje was part of the tour to the West Indies; he featured in the three ODI's, and in the Test match at Bridgetown that followed, he made his Test debut. This was South Africa's first Test since readmission and they came close to beating a strong West Indian side, going into the final day at 122/2 chasing 200 they collapsed to 148.\nIndia toured South Africa in 1992/93. In the first one-day international, he hit the famous six when his team needed 6 runs off only 4 balls, and was awarded Man of the match for his bowling. In the one-day series, Cronje managed just one fifty but with the ball he was economical and took his career best figures of 5/32, becoming the second South African to take five wickets in an ODI. In the Test series that followed he scored his maiden test century, 135 off 411 balls, after coming in at 0\u20131 in the second over he was last man out, after eight and three-quarter hours, in a total of 275. This contributed to South Africa's first Test win since readmission. At the end of the season in a triangular tournament with Pakistan and West Indies he scored 81 off 70 balls against Pakistan.\nIn South Africa's next Test series against Sri Lanka, Cronje scored his second Test century, 122 in the second Test in Colombo; the victory margin of an innings and 208 runs is a South African record. He finished the series with 237 runs at 59.25 after scoring 73* in the drawn third Test.\n\n\n=== Stand-in captain ===\nIn 1993\u201394, there was another Castle Cup/Total Power Series double for Orange Free State. In international cricket, he was named as vice-captain for the tour of Australia despite being the youngest member of the squad. In the first ODI of the triangular tournament with New Zealand and Australia, he guided South Africa to victory against Australia at the MCG with 91*, which won him the man of the match award. He scored 71 in a rain-affected first test at Melbourne before a tense second test that South Africa won by 5 runs. An injury to captain Kepler Wessels meant Cronje was captain for the final day of the match. Between the second and third tests, the one-day tournament continued, now with Cronje as captain, South Africa made the final series but lost it 2\u20131 to Australia. He became South Africa's second youngest Test captain, after Murray Bisset in 1898\u201399, when he led the team for the third test at Adelaide but it was an unsuccessful start to his captaincy career as the series was squared.\nIn February 1994, there was the return series as Australia toured South Africa. Cronje started the ODI series with scores of 112, 97, 45 and 50* and when Australia played Orange Free State in their final match before the first Test, Cronje hit 251 off 306 balls, 200 of these came on the final day in which 294 runs were added. Despite this, Orange Free State lost the match. In the first test at Johannesburg, he added another century as South Africa won by 197 runs. This innings was the end of a 14-day period in which he'd scored 721 runs against the Aussies. However, he failed to reach fifty in the next two tests and four ODIs as both series were drawn.\nThere was another drawn series when South Africa toured England in 1994. Cronje scored only one century on the whole tour and scored only 90 runs in the three-test series. In October 1994, South Africa again came up against Australia in a triangular one day series also featuring Pakistan. Cronje scored 354 runs at an average of 88.50. Despite this, South Africa lost all their matches. This series was Bob Woolmer's first as coach and Kepler Wessels' last as captain. Cronje, who'd previously been vice-captain, was named as captain for the test series with New Zealand in 1994\u201395.\n\n\n=== Permanent captain ===\n\nSouth Africa lost the first Test in Johannesburg but before the second test the two teams plus Pakistan and Sri Lanka competed for the Mandela Trophy, New Zealand failed to gain a win in the six match round robin stage while South Africa beat Pakistan in the final. This changed the momentum as South Africa secured wins in Durban and Cape Town, where Cronje scored his fourth test century, he was the first captain since W. G. Grace to win a three-match rubber after being one down.\nIn early 1995, South Africa won one-off tests against both Pakistan and New Zealand, in Auckland Cronje scored the only century of the match before a final day declaration left his bowlers barely enough time to dismiss the Kiwis.\nIn October 1995, South Africa won a one-off Test with Zimbabwe. Cronje scored a second innings 54* to guide them to a seven wicket win. In two one-dayers that followed, he took five wickets as South Africa comfortably won both. South Africa won the five Test series against England 1\u20130 despite Cronje struggling, scoring 113 runs at 18.83. However, he top scored in the one-day series that they won 6\u20131.\nIn the 1996 World Cup, he scored 78 and 45* against New Zealand and Pakistan respectively as South Africa won their group but in the Quarter final with West Indies a Brian Lara century ended their ten-game winning streak.\nThe 1996\u201397 season featured back-to-back series with India. The first away was lost 2\u20131. The home series was won 2\u20130. In the six tests combined, Cronje managed one fifty. Cronje produced better form against Australia, averaging over 50 in both test and ODI series although both were lost.\nCronje started 1997\u201398 by leading South Africa to their first series victory in Pakistan, his batting continued to struggle with his biggest contribution being taking the wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq and Moin Khan in the Third Test.\n\n\n=== Better form ===\nCronje once again came up against Australia and once again ended on the losing side. In the triangular one day series they won the group with Australia just scraping through, they also won the first 'final' but South Africa lost the last two finals. During the group matches Cronje had threatened to lead his team off after Pat Symcox had missiles thrown at him, Symcox had the last laugh ending the match with 4/24. Before the Test series started he scored consecutive centuries against Tasmania and Australia A these were his first in two years.\nIn the first Test, Cronje scored 70 as South Africa saved the match; in the second Test, he lasted 335 minutes for his 88. Despite this, they lost by an innings. In the third Test, they scored 517 and although Mark Taylor carried his bat for 169, Australia needed to bat 109 overs to save the match. Mark Waugh batted 404 minutes, and, despite controversy when Waugh hit one of his bails off (under Law 35 he was adjudged to have finished his stroke and therefore given not out), South Africa fell three wickets short. Cronje put a stump through the umpires' dressing room door after the match and was lucky to avoid a ban.Cronje missed the first Test of the series with Pakistan because of a knee injury. The second Test at Durban was lost, but he top scored at Port Elizabeth with 85, to help square the three Test series 1\u20131. There was still time in the season for a two-Test series with Sri Lanka. The first was won with Cronje scoring 49 and 74; in the second Test, he took 3/14, his best bowling in Tests, and smashed 82 off 63 balls, his fifty being brought up with three consecutive sixes off Muttiah Muralitharan, and was reached off just 31 balls; at the time, it was the second fastest in Tests after Kapil Dev's. In the triangular series, which South Africa won, he scored only one fifty at East London where he also took 2/17 off 10 overs.During the 1998 Test series against England, Cronje scored five consecutive fifties, having failed to score one in the nine previous Tests against them. In his fiftieth Test, at Trent Bridge he scored 126, his sixth and last Test century and his first in 29 matches. During his second innings of 67, he passed 3,000 runs \u2013 only the second South African to do so. However, England won the Test, and the one at Headingley, to win the series 2\u20131, Cronje finished the series as South Africa's top scorer with 401 runs at 66.83.\n\n\n=== Whitewash, tie and forfeit ===\nIn the West Indies series of 1998\u201399, Cronje captained South Africa to their only whitewash in a five Test series. His best batting against West Indies came when playing for Free State; he scored 158* as they chased down 438 and made up a first innings deficit of 249. In the ODI series he was South Africa's top scorer and took 11 wickets at 14.72 as South Africa won 6\u20131.\nIn March 1999, they toured New Zealand, beating them 1\u20130 in the Test series and 3\u20132 in the one-dayers.\nAt the 1999 World Cup, Cronje finished with 98 runs at 12.25 as South Africa were eliminated after the famous tied semi-final against Australia at Edgbaston. In the first match of the tournament versus India, Cronje came onto the field with an earpiece wired to coach Bob Woolmer, but at the first drinks break match referee Talat Ali ordered him to remove it.In October 1999, Cronje became South Africa's highest Test run scorer during the first Test against Zimbabwe. The two Test series was won 2\u20130 thanks to innings victories. South Africa won the series with England in the fourth Test at Cape Town, Cronje's fiftieth as captain.\nThe fifth test of the 1999\u20132000 South Africa versus England series at Centurion was ruined by rain, entering the final day only 45 overs had been possible with South Africa 155/6. On the final morning as they batted on, news filtered through that the captains had met and were going to \"make a game of it\". A target of 250 from 70 overs was agreed. When South Africa reached 248/8, Cronje declared; both teams then forfeited an innings leaving England a target of 249 to win the Test, which they did with two wickets left and only five balls remaining. It ended South Africa's 14-game unbeaten streak in Test cricket. It was later learnt Cronje accepted money and a gift from a bookmaker in return for making an early declaration in this Test. (See below).\nCronje top scored with 56 after South Africa were left reeling at 21\u20135 in the Final of the triangular tournament which featured England and Zimbabwe.On 31 March 2000, his cricket career finished with a 73-ball 79 against Pakistan in the final of Sharjah Cup 1999/2000.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nUnder Cronje's captaincy, South Africa won 27 Tests and lost 11, completing series victories against every team except Australia.He captained the One Day International team to 99 wins out of 138 matches with one tied match and three no results. He holds the South African record for matches won as captain, and his record of captaining his side in 138 matches stands bettered only by Graeme Smith's 149 matches as ODI captain. His 99 wins as captain makes him the fourth most successful captain worldwide in terms of matches won, behind Ricky Ponting, Allan Border and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and in terms of percentage of wins (73.70), behind Ponting and Clive Lloyd.Between September 1993 and March 2000, he played in 162 consecutive ODIs, a South African record.Cronje has the record for playing the most consecutive ODI matches as captain (130) and is the only player to play in 100+ consecutive ODI matches as captain.\n\n\n== Match fixing ==\n\nOn 7 April 2000, it was revealed there was a conversation between Cronje and Sanjay Chawla, a representative of an Indian betting syndicate, over match-fixing allegations. Three other players, Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje, and Pieter Strydom, were also implicated. After an enquiry by the King Commission, Cronje was banned from any involvement in cricket for life. He challenged his life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001, his application was dismissed.After 13 years, on 22 July 2013, the Indian Police registered a First Information Report for match-fixing in 2000; the charge sheet in the case involving a few South African cricketers including its former captain Hansie Cronje, was finally filed. The scandal was one of the biggest ever to have hit international cricket until the Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 1 June 2002, Cronje's scheduled flight home from Johannesburg to George was grounded. He then hitched a ride as the only passenger aboard a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop aircraft. Near George airport, the pilots lost visibility in clouds and were unable to land, partly due to unusable navigational equipment. While circling, the plane crashed into the Outeniqua Mountains northeast of the airport. Cronje, aged 32, and the two pilots were killed instantly.\nIn August 2006, an inquest into the plane crash was opened by South Africa's High Court. The inquest concluded that \"the death of the deceased Wessel Johannes Cronje was brought about by an act or omission prima facie amounting to an offence on the part of pilots.\"Theories that Cronje was murdered on the orders of a cricket betting syndicate flourished after his death and were most recently re-floated by former Nottinghamshire coach Clive Rice in the wake of the death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer in March 2007. It was alleged that he was murdered to hide the truths behind match-fixing.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHansie Cronje married Bertha Hans on 8 April 1995. They had no children. Hansie's widow later married Jacques Du Plessis, a financial auditor, in 2003. It was reported that the private ceremony was attended by Hansie's parents and siblings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeclaration and forfeiture \u2013 Cronje was the only captain to ever forfeit an innings during a Test match\nList of South Africans \u2013 voted 11 in the SABC3's Great South Africans\nList of people who died in aviation-related incidents\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\nHansie \u2013 biographical film about Cronje after his life-ban\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHansie Cronje at ESPNcricinfo\nMatch fixing scandal\nHansie Cronje killed in a plane crash\nNot Cricket 2 \u2013 The Captain and The Bookmaker"

        "article": "Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey  (later 17th Duke of Denver) is the fictional protagonist in a series of detective novels and short stories by Dorothy L. Sayers (and their continuation by Jill Paton Walsh). A dilettante who solves mysteries for his own amusement, Wimsey is an archetype for the British gentleman detective. He is often assisted by his valet and former batman, Mervyn Bunter; by his good friend and later brother-in-law, police detective Charles Parker; and, in a few books, by Harriet Vane, who becomes his wife.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nBorn in 1890 and ageing in real time, Wimsey is described as being of average height, with straw-coloured hair, a beaked nose, and a vaguely foolish face. Reputedly his looks were patterned after those of academic and poet Roy Ridley, whom Sayers briefly met after witnessing him read his Newdigate Prize-winning poem \"Oxford\" at the Encaenia ceremony in July 1913. Wimsey also possessed considerable intelligence and athletic ability, evidenced by his playing cricket for Oxford University while earning a First. He created a spectacularly successful publicity campaign for Whifflet cigarettes while working for Pym's Publicity Ltd, and at age 40 was able to turn three cartwheels in the office corridor, stopping just short of the boss's open office door (Murder Must Advertise).\nAmong Lord Peter's hobbies, in addition to criminology, is collecting incunabula, books from the earliest days of printing. He is an expert on matters of food (and especially wine), male fashion, and classical music. He excels at the piano, including Bach's works for keyboard instruments. One of Lord Peter's cars is a 12-cylinder (\"double-six\") 1927 Daimler four-seater, which (like all his cars) he calls \"Mrs Merdle\" after a character in Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit who \"hated fuss\".\n\nLord Peter Wimsey's ancestry begins with the 12th-century knight Gerald de Wimsey, who went with King Richard the Lionheart on the Third Crusade and took part in the Siege of Acre. This makes the Wimseys an unusually ancient family, since \"Very few English noble families go that far in the first creation; rebellions and monarchic head choppings had seen to that\", as reviewer Janet Hitchman noted in the introduction to Striding Folly. The family coat of arms is blazoned as \"Sable, 3 mice courant, argent; crest, a domestic cat couched as to spring, proper\". The family motto, displayed under its coat of arms, is \"As my Whimsy takes me.\"\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nLord Peter was the second of the three children of Mortimer Wimsey, 15th Duke of Denver, and Honoria Lucasta Delagardie, who lives on throughout the novels as the Dowager Duchess of Denver. She is witty and intelligent, and strongly supports her younger son, whom she plainly prefers over her less intelligent, more conventional older son Gerald, the 16th Duke. Gerald's snobbish wife, Helen, detests Peter. Gerald's son and heir is the devil-may-care Viscount St George. Lady Mary, the younger sister of the 16th Duke and Lord Peter, leans strongly to the political left and scandalises Helen by marrying a policeman of working-class origins.\nLord Peter Wimsey is called \"Lord\" as he is the younger son of a duke. This is a courtesy title; he is not a peer and has no right to sit in the House of Lords, nor does the courtesy title pass on to any offspring he may have.\nAs a boy, Peter was, to the great distress of his father, strongly attached to an old, smelly poacher living at the edge of the family estate. In his youth, Peter was influenced by his maternal uncle, Paul Delagardie, who took it upon himself to instruct his nephew in the facts of life \u2013 how to conduct various love affairs and treat his lovers. Lord Peter was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in history. He was also an outstanding cricketer, whose performance was still well remembered decades later. Though not taking up an academic career, he was left with an enduring and deep love for Oxford.\n\n\n=== Great War and aftermath ===\nTo his uncle's disappointment, Wimsey fell deeply in love with a young woman named Barbara and became engaged to her. When the First World War broke out, he hastened to join the British Army, releasing Barbara from her engagement in case he was killed or mutilated. The girl later married another, less principled officer.\nWimsey served on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918, reaching the rank of Major in the Rifle Brigade. He was appointed an Intelligence Officer, and on one occasion he infiltrated the staff room of a German officer. Though not explicitly stated, that feat implies that Wimsey spoke a fluent and unaccented German. As noted in Have His Carcase, he communicated at that time with British Intelligence using the Playfair cipher and became proficient in its use.\nFor reasons never clarified, after the end of his spy mission, Wimsey in the later part of the war moved from Intelligence and resumed the role of a regular line officer. He was a conscientious and effective commanding officer, popular with the men under his command\u2014an affection still retained by Wimsey's former soldiers many years after the war, as is evident from a short passage in Clouds of Witness and an extensive reminiscence in Gaudy Night.\nIn particular, while in the army he met Sergeant Mervyn Bunter, who had previously been in service. In 1918, Wimsey was wounded by artillery fire near Caudry in France. He suffered a breakdown due to shell shock (which we now call post-traumatic stress disorder but which was then often thought, by those without first-hand experience of it, to be a species of malingering) and was eventually sent home. While sharing this experience, which the Dowager Duchess referred to as \"a jam\", Wimsey and Bunter arranged that if they were both to survive the war, Bunter would become Wimsey's valet. Throughout the books, Bunter takes care to address Wimsey as \"My Lord\". Nevertheless, he is a friend as well as a servant, and Wimsey again and again expresses amazement at Bunter's high efficiency and competence in virtually every sphere of life.\nAfter the war, Wimsey was ill for many months, recovering at the family's ancestral home in Duke's Denver, a fictional setting\u2014as is the Dukedom of Denver\u2014about 15 miles (24 km) beyond the real Denver in Norfolk, on the A10 near Downham Market. Wimsey was for a time unable to give servants any orders whatsoever, since his wartime experience made him associate the giving of an order with causing the death of the person to whom the order was given. Bunter arrived and, with the approval of the Dowager Duchess, took up his post as valet. Bunter moved Wimsey to a London flat at 110A Piccadilly, W1, while Wimsey recovered. Even much later, however, Wimsey would have relapses\u2014especially when his actions caused a murderer to be hanged. As noted in Whose Body?, on such occasions Bunter would take care of Wimsey and tenderly put him to bed, and they would revert to being \"Major Wimsey\" and \"Sergeant Bunter\".\nIn the reissue of The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club (1935), the biography of Wimsey is \"brought up to date\" by his uncle, Paul Austin Delagardie, purportedly at the request of Sayers herself, further giving the illusion that he is a real person. At this point, Wimsey is claimed to be 45 years old and \"time he was settled\". The biography takes up the last eight pages of the book and concludes with the statement that Wimsey \"has always had everything except the things he really wanted, and I suppose he is luckier than most.\"\n\n\n=== Detective work ===\nWimsey begins his hobby of investigation by recovering The Attenbury Emeralds in 1921. At the beginning of Whose Body?, there appears the unpleasant Inspector Sugg, who is extremely hostile to Wimsey and tries to exclude him from the investigation (reminiscent of the relations between Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Lestrade). However, Wimsey is able to bypass Sugg through his friendship with Scotland Yard detective Charles Parker, a sergeant in 1921. At the end of Whose Body?, Wimsey generously allows Sugg to take completely undeserved credit for the solution; the grateful Sugg cannot go on with his hostility to Wimsey. In later books, Sugg fades away and Wimsey's relations with the police become dominated by his amicable partnership with Parker, who eventually rises to the rank of Commander (and becomes Wimsey's brother in law).\nBunter, a man of many talents himself, not least photography, often proves instrumental in Wimsey's investigations. However, Wimsey is not entirely well. At the end of the investigation in Whose Body? (1923), Wimsey hallucinates that he is back in the trenches. He soon recovers his senses and goes on a long holiday.\nThe next year, Wimsey travels (in Clouds of Witness, 1926) to the fictional Riddlesdale in North Yorkshire to assist his elder brother Gerald, who has been accused of murdering Captain Denis Cathcart, their sister's fianc\u00e9. As Gerald is the Duke of Denver, he is tried by the entire House of Lords, as required by the law at that time, to much scandal and the distress of his wife Helen. Their sister, Lady Mary, also falls under suspicion. Lord Peter clears the Duke and Lady Mary, to whom Parker is attracted.\nAs a result of the slaughter of men in the First World War, there was in the UK a considerable imbalance between the sexes. It is not exactly known when Wimsey recruited Miss Climpson to run an undercover employment agency for women, a means to garner information from the otherwise inaccessible world of spinsters and widows, but it is prior to Unnatural Death (1927), in which Miss Climpson assists Wimsey's investigation of the suspicious death of an elderly cancer patient. Wimsey's highly effective idea is that a male detective going around and asking questions is likely to arouse suspicion, while a middle-aged woman doing it would be dismissed as a gossip and people would speak openly to her.\nAs recounted in the short story \"The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba\", in December 1927 Wimsey fakes his own death, supposedly while hunting big game in Tanganyika, to penetrate and break up a particularly dangerous and well-organised criminal gang. Only Wimsey's mother and sister, the loyal Bunter and Inspector Parker know he is still alive. Emerging victorious after more than a year masquerading as \"the disgruntled sacked servant Rogers\", Wimsey remarks that \"We shall have an awful time with the lawyers, proving that I am me.\" In fact, he returns smoothly to his old life, and the interlude is never referred to in later books.\nDuring the 1920s, Wimsey has affairs with various women, which are the subject of much gossip in Britain and Europe. This part of his life remains hazy: it is hardly ever mentioned in the books set in the same period; most of the scanty information on the subject is given in flashbacks from later times, after he meets Harriet Vane and relations with other women become a closed chapter. In Busman's Honeymoon Wimsey facetiously refers to a gentleman's duty \"to remember whom he had taken to bed\" so as not to embarrass his bedmate by calling her by the wrong name.\nThere are several references to a relationship with a famous Viennese opera singer, and Bunter\u2014who evidently was involved with this, as with other parts of his master's life\u2014recalls Wimsey being very angry with a French mistress who mistreated her own servant.\nThe only one of Wimsey's earlier women to appear in person is the artist Marjorie Phelps, who plays an important role in The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club. She has known Wimsey for years and is attracted to him, though it is not explicitly stated whether they were lovers. Wimsey likes her, respects her, and enjoys her company\u2014but that is not enough. In Strong Poison, she is the first person other than Wimsey himself to realise that he has fallen in love with Harriet.\nIn Strong Poison Lord Peter encounters Harriet Vane, a cerebral, Oxford-educated mystery writer, while she is on trial for the murder of her former lover in December 1929. He falls in love with her at first sight. He saves Harriet from the gallows, but she believes that gratitude is not a good foundation for marriage, and politely but firmly declines his frequent proposals. Lord Peter encourages his friend and foil, Chief Inspector Charles Parker, to propose to his sister, Lady Mary Wimsey, despite the great difference in their rank and wealth. They marry and have a son, named Charles Peter (\"Peterkin\"), and a daughter, Mary Lucasta (\"Polly\"). Visiting the Fen country in Easter 1930 (in The Nine Tailors) Wimsey must unravel a 20-year-old case of missing jewels, an unknown corpse, a missing World War I soldier believed alive, a murderous escaped convict believed dead, and a mysterious code concerning church bells.While on a fishing holiday in Scotland later in 1930, Wimsey takes part in the investigation of the murder of an artist, related in Five Red Herrings. Despite the rejection of his marriage proposal, he continues to court Miss Vane. In Have His Carcase, in 1931, he finds Harriet is not in London, but learns from a reporter that she has discovered a corpse while on a walking holiday on England's south coast. Wimsey is at her hotel the next morning. He not only investigates the death and offers proposals of marriage, but also acts as Harriet's patron and protector from press and police. Despite a prickly relationship, they work together to identify the murderer.\nBack in London in 1932, Wimsey goes under cover as \"Death Bredon\" at an advertising firm, working as a copywriter (Murder Must Advertise). Bredon is framed for murder, leading Charles Parker to \"arrest\" Bredon for murder in front of numerous witnesses. To distinguish Death Bredon from Lord Peter Wimsey, Parker smuggles Wimsey out of the police station and urges him to get into the papers. Accordingly, Wimsey accompanies \"a Royal personage\" to a public event, leading the press to carry pictures of both \"Bredon\" and Wimsey.\nBy 1935 Lord Peter is in continental Europe, acting as an unofficial attach\u00e9 to the British Foreign Office. Harriet Vane contacts him about a problem she has been asked to investigate in her college at Oxford (Gaudy Night). At the end of their investigation, Vane finally accepts Wimsey's proposal of marriage.\nThe couple marry on 8 October 1935, at St Cross Church, Oxford, as depicted in the opening collection of letters and diary entries in Busman's Honeymoon. The Wimseys honeymoon at Talboys, a house in east Hertfordshire near Harriet's childhood home, which Peter has bought for her as a wedding present. There they find the body of the previous owner, and spend their honeymoon solving the case, thus having the aphoristic \"Busman's Honeymoon\".\nOver the next five years, according to Sayers' short stories, the Wimseys have three sons: Bredon Delagardie Peter Wimsey (born in October 1936 in the story \"The Haunted Policeman\"); Roger Wimsey (born 1938), and Paul Wimsey (born 1940). However, according to the wartime publications of The Wimsey Papers, published in The Spectator, the second son was called Paul. In The Attenbury Emeralds, Paul is again the second son and Roger is the third son. In the subsequent The Late Scholar, Roger is not mentioned at all. It may be presumed that Paul is named after Lord Peter's maternal uncle Paul Delagardie. \"Roger\" is an ancestral Wimsey name.\nIn Sayers's final Wimsey story, the 1942 short story \"Talboys\", Peter and Harriet are enjoying rural domestic bliss with their three sons when Bredon, their first-born, is accused of the theft of prize peaches from the neighbour's tree. Peter and the accused set off to investigate and, of course, prove Bredon's innocence.\n\n\n== Fictional bibliography ==\n\nWimsey is described as having authored numerous books, among them the following fictitious works:\n\nNotes on the Collecting of Incunabula\nThe Murderer's Vade-Mecum\n\n\n== The stories ==\nDorothy Sayers wrote 11 Wimsey novels and a number of short stories featuring Wimsey and his family. Other recurring characters include Inspector Charles Parker, the family solicitor Mr Murbles, barrister Sir Impey Biggs, journalist Salcombe Hardy, and family friend and financial whiz the Honourable Freddy Arbuthnot, who finds himself entangled in the case in the first of the Wimsey books, Whose Body? (1923).\nSayers wrote no more Wimsey murder mysteries, and only one story involving him, after the outbreak of World War II. In The Wimsey Papers, a series of fictionalised commentaries in the form of mock letters between members of the Wimsey family published in The Spectator, there is a reference to Harriet's difficulty in continuing to write murder mysteries at a time when European dictators were openly committing mass murders with impunity; this seems to have reflected Sayers' own wartime feeling.\nThe Wimsey Papers included a reference to Wimsey and Bunter setting out during the war on a secret mission of espionage in Europe, and provide the ironic epitaph Wimsey writes for himself: \"Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity\". The papers also incidentally show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar \u2014 though in fundamental disagreement \u2014 with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground.\nThe only occasion when Sayers returned to Wimsey was the 1942 short story \"Talboys\". The war at that time devastating Europe received only a single oblique reference. Though Sayers lived until 1957, she never again took up the Wimsey books after this final effort. In effect, rather than killing off her detective, as Conan Doyle unsuccessfully tried with his, Sayers pensioned Wimsey off to a happy, satisfying old age. Thus, Peter Wimsey remained forever fixed on the background of inter-war England, and the books are nowadays often read for their evocation of that period as much as for the intrinsic detective mysteries.\nIt was left to Jill Paton Walsh to extend Wimsey's career through and beyond the Second World War. In the continuations Thrones, Dominations (1998), A Presumption of Death (2002), The Attenbury Emeralds (2010), and The Late Scholar (2014), Harriet lives with the children at Talboys, Wimsey and Bunter have returned successfully from their secret mission in 1940, and his nephew Lord St. George is killed while serving as an RAF pilot in the Battle of Britain. Consequently, when Wimsey's brother dies of a heart attack in 1951 during a fire in Bredon Hall at Duke's Denver, Wimsey becomes \u2014 very reluctantly \u2014 the Duke of Denver.  Their Graces are then drawn into a mystery at a fictional Oxford college.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIn How I Came to Invent the Character of Lord Peter Wimsey, Sayers wrote:\n\n Lord Peter's large income... I deliberately gave him... After all it cost me nothing and at the time I was particularly hard up and it gave me pleasure to spend his fortune for him. When I was dissatisfied with my single unfurnished room I took a luxurious flat for him in Piccadilly. When my cheap rug got a hole in it, I ordered him an Aubusson carpet. When I had no money to pay my bus fare I presented him with a Daimler double-six, upholstered in a style of sober magnificence, and when I felt dull I let him drive it. I can heartily recommend this inexpensive way of furnishing to all who are discontented with their incomes. It relieves the mind and does no harm to anybody.\nJanet Hitchman, in the preface to Striding Folly, remarks that \"Wimsey may have been the sad ghost of a wartime lover(...). Oxford, as everywhere in the country, was filled with bereaved women, but it may have been more noticeable in university towns where a whole year's intake could be wiped out in France in less than an hour.\" There is, however, no verifiable evidence of any such World War I lover of Sayers on whom the character of Wimsey might be based.\nAnother theory is that Wimsey was based, at least in part, on Eric Whelpton, who was a close friend of Sayers at Oxford. Ian Carmichael, who played the part of Wimsey in the first BBC television adaptation and studied the character and the books thoroughly, said that the character was Sayers' conception of the 'ideal man', based in part on her earlier romantic misfortunes.\n\n\n== Social satire ==\nMany episodes in the Wimsey books express a mild satire on the British class system, in particular in depicting the relationship between Wimsey and Bunter. The two of them are clearly the best and closest of friends, yet Bunter is invariably punctilious in using \"my lord\" even when they are alone, and \"his lordship\" in company. In a brief passage written from Bunter's point of view in Busman's Honeymoon Bunter is seen, even in the privacy of his own mind, to be thinking of his employer as \"His Lordship\". Wimsey and Bunter even mock the Jeeves and Wooster relationship.\nIn Whose Body?, when Wimsey is caught by a severe recurrence of his First World War shell-shock and nightmares and being taken care of by Bunter, the two of them revert to being \"Major Wimsey\" and \"Sergeant Bunter\". In that role, Bunter, sitting at the bedside of the sleeping Wimsey, is seen to mutter affectionately, \"Bloody little fool!\"In \"The Vindictive Story of the Footsteps That Ran\", the staunchly democratic Dr Hartman invites Bunter to sit down to eat together with himself and Wimsey, at the doctor's modest apartment. Wimsey does not object, but Bunter strongly does: \"If I may state my own preference, sir, it would be to wait upon you and his lordship in the usual manner\". Whereupon Wimsey remarks: \"Bunter likes me to know my place\".At the conclusion of Strong Poison, Inspector Parker asks \"What would one naturally do if one found one's water-bottle empty?\" (a point of crucial importance in solving the book's mystery). Wimsey promptly answers, \"Ring the bell.\" Whereupon Miss Murchison, the indefatigable investigator employed by Wimsey for much of this book, comments \"Or, if one wasn't accustomed to be waited on, one might use the water from the bedroom jug.\"\nGeorge Orwell was highly critical of this aspect of the Wimsey books: \"... Even she [Sayers] is not so far removed from Peg's Paper as might appear at a casual glance. It is, after all, a very ancient trick to write novels with a lord for a hero. Where Miss Sayers has shown more astuteness than most is in perceiving that you can carry that kind of thing off a great deal better if you pretend to treat it as a joke. By being, on the surface, a little ironical about Lord Peter Wimsey and his noble ancestors, she is enabled to lay on the snobbishness ('his lordship' etc.) much thicker than any overt snob would dare to do\". In fact, Sayers took the trouble to make the character halfway plausible by having his manner result from the stress of fighting in the Great War (which included an episode of being buried alive). Wimsey was not like that before the War, but afterward attempted to cope with his haunting memories by adopting \u201ca mask of impenetrable frivolity\u201d. Thus, it is Wimsey himself who is laying it on thick, since the character requires that type of mockery, either of himself or of public perceptions of his class.\n\n\n== Dramatic adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1935, the British film The Silent Passenger was released, in which Lord Peter, played by well-known comic actor Peter Haddon, solved a mystery on the boat train crossing the English Channel. Sayers disliked the film and James Brabazon describes it as an \"oddity, in which Dorothy's contribution was altered out of all recognition.\"\nThe novel Busman's Honeymoon was originally a stage play by Sayers and her friend Muriel St. Clare Byrne. A 1940 film of Busman's Honeymoon (US: The Haunted Honeymoon), starring Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings as Lord and Lady Peter was released (with Seymour Hicks as Bunter), but the characters and events bore little resemblance to Sayers's writing, and she refused even to see the film.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nA BBC television version of the play Busman's Honeymoon with Harold Warrender as Lord Peter, was transmitted live on the BBC Television Service on 2 October 1947. A second live BBC version was broadcast on 3 October 1957, with Peter Gray as Wimsey.Several other Lord Peter Wimsey novels were made into television productions by the BBC, in two separate series. Wimsey was played by Ian Carmichael, with Bunter being played by Glyn Houston (with Derek Newark stepping in for The Unpleasantness at The Bellona Club), in a series of separate serials under the umbrella title Lord Peter Wimsey, that ran between 1972 and 1975, adapting five novels (Clouds of Witness, The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, Five Red Herrings, Murder Must Advertise and The Nine Tailors).\nEdward Petherbridge played Lord Peter for BBC Television in 1987, in which three of the four major Wimsey/Vane novels (Strong Poison, Have His Carcase and Gaudy Night) were dramatised under the umbrella title A Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery. Harriet Vane was played by Harriet Walter and Bunter was played by Richard Morant. The BBC was unable to secure the rights to turn Busman's Honeymoon into a proposed fourth and last part of the planned 13-episode series, so the series was produced as ten episodes. (Edward Petherbridge later played Wimsey in the UK production of the Busman's Honeymoon play staged at the Lyric Hammersmith and on tour in 1988, with the role of Harriet being taken by his real-life spouse, Emily Richard.)\nBoth sets of adaptations were critically successful, with both Carmichael and Petherbridge's respective performances being widely praised. However, the two portrayals are quite different from one another: Carmichael's Peter is eccentric, jolly and foppish with occasional glimpses of the inner wistful, romantic soul, whereas Petherbridge's portrayal was more calm, solemn and had a stiff upper lip, subtly downplaying many of the character's eccentricities. Both the 1970s productions and the 1987 series are now available on videotape and DVD.\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nAdaptations of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels appeared on BBC Radio from the 1930s onwards. An adaptation of the short story \"The Footsteps That Ran\" dramatised by John Cheatle appeared on the BBC Home Service in November 1939 with Cecil Trouncer as Wimsey. Rex Harrison took on the role in an adaptation of \"Absolutely Everywhere\" on the Home Service on 5 March 1940. The short story \"The Man With No Face\" was dramatised by Audrey Lucas for the Home Service Saturday-Night Theatre play, broadcast on 3 April 1943 with Robert Holmes in the lead role.A four-part adaptation of The Nine Tailors adapted by Giles Cooper and starring Alan Wheatley as Wimsey was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in August 1954.Ian Carmichael reprised his television role as Lord Peter in ten radio adaptations for BBC Radio 4 of Sayers's Wimsey novels between 1973 and 1983, all of which have been available on cassette and CD from the BBC Radio Collection. These co-starred Peter Jones as Bunter. In the original series no adaptation was made of the seminal Gaudy Night, perhaps because the leading character in this novel is Harriet and not Peter; this was corrected in 2005 when a version specially recorded for the BBC Radio Collection was released starring Carmichael and Joanna David. The CD also includes a panel discussion on the novel, the major participants in which are P. D. James and Jill Paton Walsh. Gaudy Night was released as an unabridged audio book read by Ian Carmichael in 1993.\nGary Bond starred as Lord Peter Wimsey and John Cater as Bunter in two single-episode BBC Radio 4 adaptations: The Nine Tailors on 25 December 1986 and Whose Body on 26 December 1987. Simon Russell Beale played Wimsey in an adaptation of Strong Poison dramatised by Michael Bakewell in 1999.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nWith year of first publication\n\nWhose Body?

        "article": "Sir Harry Paget Flashman  is a fictional character created by Thomas Hughes (1822\u20131896) in the semi-autobiographical Tom Brown's School Days (1857) and later developed by George MacDonald Fraser (1925\u20132008). Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as The Flashman Papers, with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film Royal Flash.In Tom Brown's School Days (1857), Flashman is portrayed as a notorious Rugby School bully who persecutes Tom Brown and is finally expelled for drunkenness, at which point he simply disappears. Fraser decided to write the story of Flashman's later life, in which the school bully would be identified as an \"illustrious Victorian soldier\", experiencing many of the 19th-century wars and adventures of the Empire and rising to high rank in the British Army, to be acclaimed as a great warrior, while still remaining \"a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward\u2014and, oh yes, a toady.\" Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs away from danger. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.\n\n\n== Flashman's origins ==\nFraser gave Flashman a lifespan from 1822 to 1915 and a birth-date of 5 May. He also provided Flashman's first and middle names, as Hughes's novel had given Flashman only one, using the names to make an ironic allusion to Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey.  Paget was one of the heroes of Waterloo, who cuckolded the Duke of Wellington's brother Henry Wellesley and later\u2014in one of the period's more celebrated scandals\u2014married Lady Anglesey, after Wellesley had divorced her for adultery.In Flashman, Flashman says that his great-grandfather, Jack Flashman, made the family fortune in America, trading in rum, slaves and \"piracy too, I shouldn't wonder\". Despite their wealth, the Flashmans \"were never the thing\"; Flashman quotes the diarist Henry Greville's comment that \"the coarse streak showed through, generation after generation, like dung beneath a rosebush\". Harry Flashman's father, Henry Buckley Flashman, appears in Black Ajax (1997). Buckley, a bold young officer in the British cavalry, was wounded in action at Talavera in 1809. He then tried to get into \"society\" by sponsoring bare-knuckle boxer Tom Molineaux (the first black man to contend for a championship) and subsequently married Flashman's mother Lady Alicia Paget, a fictional relation of the real Marquess of Anglesey. Buckley also served as a Member of Parliament (MP) but was \"sent to the knacker's yard at Reform\". Beside politics, his interests were drinking, fox hunting (riding to hounds), and women.\n\n\n== Character ==\nFlashman is a large man, six feet two inches (1.88 m) tall and close to 13 stone (about 180 pounds or 82 kg). In Flashman and the Tiger, he mentions that one of his grandchildren has black hair and eyes, resembling him in his younger years. His dark colouring frequently enabled him to pass (in disguise) for a Pashtun. He claims only three natural talents: horsemanship, facility with foreign languages, and fornication. He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play rugby football). He can also display a winning personality when he wants to, and is very skilled at flattering those more important than himself without appearing servile.\nAs he admits in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger if there was any way to do so, and has on some occasions collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers think he is excited, enraged, or exuberant\u2014as a hero ought to be.\nAfter his expulsion from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks for an easy life. He has his wealthy father buy him an officer's commission in the fashionable 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The 11th, commanded by Lord Cardigan, later involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade, has just returned from India and are not likely to be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.A duel with another officer over a French courtesan leads to his being temporarily stationed in Paisley, Scotland. There he meets and deflowers Elspeth Morrison, daughter of a wealthy textile manufacturer, whom he has to marry in a \"shotgun wedding\" under threat of a horsewhipping by her uncle. But marriage to the daughter of a mere businessman forces his transferral from the snobbish 11th Hussars. He is sent to India to make a career in the army of the East India Company. Unfortunately, his language talent and his habit of flattery bring him to the attention of the Governor-General. The Governor does him the (very much unwanted) favour of assigning him as aide to General Elphinstone in Afghanistan. Flashman survives the ensuing debacle by a mixture of sheer luck and unstinting cowardice. He becomes an unwitting hero: the defender of Piper's Fort, where he is the only surviving white man, and is found by the relieving troops clutching the flag and surrounded by enemy dead. Of course, Flashman had arrived at the fort by accident, collapsed in terror rather than fighting, been forced to stand and show fight by his subordinate, and is 'rumbled' for a complete coward. He had been trying to surrender the colours, not defend them. Happily for him, all inconvenient witnesses had been killed.\nThis incident sets the tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years or so, he is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century\u2014always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters of the period (the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and the Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.\nDespite his admitted cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting when he has to. Though he dodges danger as much as he can, and runs away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides all the way to the Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.\nFlashman surrenders to fear in front of witnesses only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper's Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his bed at the start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself right in the middle of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the battery\u2014but mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.\nIn spite of his numerous character flaws, Flashman is represented as being a perceptive observer of his times (\"I saw further than most in some ways\"). In its obituary of George MacDonald Fraser, The Economist commented that realistic sharp-sightedness (\"if not much else\") was an attribute Flashman shared with his creator.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\nFlashman, an insatiable lecher, has sex with many different women over the course of his fictional adventures. His size, good looks, winning manner, and especially his splendid cavalry-style whiskers win over many women, from low to high, including many famous women, and frequent encounters with prostitutes. In Flashman and the Great Game, about halfway through his life, he counted up his sexual conquests while languishing in a dungeon at Gwalior, \"not counting return engagements\", reaching a total of 478 up to that date. Passages in Royal Flash, Flashman and the Mountain of Light, Flashman and the Dragon, Flashman and the Redskins, and Flashman and the Angel of the Lord suggest that Flashman was well endowed.\nHe was a vigorous and exciting (if sometimes selfish and rapacious) lover, and some of his partners became quite fond of him\u2014though by his own admission, others tried to kill him afterwards. The most memorable of these was Cleonie, a prostitute Flashman sold into slavery in Flashman and the Redskins. He was not above forcing himself on a partner by blackmail (e.g., the Russian countess in Flashman and the Dragon), and at least twice raped women (Narreeman, an Afghan dancing girl in Flashman, and an unnamed harem girl in Flashman's Lady).\nFlashman's stories are dominated by his numerous amorous encounters. Several of them are with prominent historical personages. These women are sometimes window dressing, sometimes pivotal characters in the unpredictable twists and turns of the books. Historical women Flashman bedded included:\n\nLola Montez (Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert James) (Royal Flash).\nJind Kaur, Dowager Maharani of Punjab (Flashman and the Mountain of Light).\nLillie Langtry, actress and mistress of Edward VII (Flashman and the Tiger)\nDaisy Brooke, socialite and mistress of Edward VII (Flashman and the Tiger)\nMangla, maid and confidant to Jind Kaur (Flashman and the Mountain of Light).\nMasteeat, Queen of the Wollo Gallas (Flashman on the March).\nQueen Ranavalona I of Madagascar (Flashman's Lady).\nThe Silk One (aka Ko Dali's daughter), consort of Yakub Beg (Flashman at the Charge).\nYehonala, Imperial Chinese concubine, later the Empress Dowager Cixi (Flashman and the Dragon).\nLakshmibai, Rani of Jhansi and leader of the Indian Mutiny (Flashman in the Great Game).He also lusted after (but never bedded):\n\nFanny Duberly, a famous army wife (Flash for Freedom!).\nAngela Burdett-Coutts, who became the richest woman in England in her twenties. She nearly dislocated his thumb repelling a \"friendly grope\" at a house-party (Flashman's Lady).\nAgnes Salm-Salm, the American wife of German Prince Felix Salm-Salm, an associate in his doomed attempts to save Maximilian I of Mexico (Flashman on the March).His fictional amours included:\n\nJudy Parsons, his father's mistress (Flashman). After a single bedding to satisfy joint lust, she and Flashman achieve a state of mutual dislike.\nJosette, mistress of Captain Bernier of the 11th Light Dragoons (Flashman).\nElspeth Rennie Morrison, his wife.\nFetnab, a dancing girl Flashy bought in Calcutta (Flashman) to teach him Hindustani, Hindi culture and purportedly ninety-seven ways of love making. Sold to a major in the artillery when Flashman is posted to Afghanistan.\nMrs Betty Parker, wife of an officer of Bengal Light Cavalry (Flashman; unconsummated). Cited by Flashman as an example of the \"inadequacies of education given to young Englishwomen\" in the Victorian era,\nBaroness Pechmann, a Bavarian noblewoman (Royal Flash).\nIrma, Grand Duchess of Strackenz (Royal Flash). For involved political reasons Flashman marries her, in the guise of a Danish prince. After an unpromising start the cold and highly-strung Duchess becomes physically infatuated with him. Decades later she pays an official visit to Queen Victoria. Flashman, by now an aging courtier, observes his erstwhile royal spouse from a safe distance.\nAn-yat-heh, an undercover agent of Harry Smith Parkes (Flashman and the Dragon).\nAphrodite, one of Miss Susie's \"gels\" (Flashman and the Redskins).\nCassy, an escaped slave who accompanied Flashman up the Mississippi (Flash for Freedom!).\nCaprice, a French intelligence agent (Flashman and the Tiger)\nLady Geraldine.\nGertrude, niece of Admiral Tegetthoff (Flashman on the March).\nPrincess \"Kralta\", European princess and agent of Otto von Bismarck (Flashman and the Tiger)\nCleonie Grouard (aka Mrs Arthur B. Candy), one of \"Miss Susie's gels\" (Flashman and the Redskins). With her he had a son, Frank Grouard.\nMrs Leo Lade, mistress of a violently jealous duke (Flashman's Lady).\n\"Lady Caroline Lamb\", a slave on board the slaver Balliol College (Flash for Freedom!).\nMrs Leslie, an unattached woman in the Meerut garrison (Flashman in the Great Game).\nMrs Madison (Flashman and the Mountain of Light).\nMalee, a servant of Uliba-Wark (Flashman on the March).\nAnnette Mandeville, a Mississippi planter's wife (Flash for Freedom! and again in Flashman and the Angel of the Lord).\nPenny/Jenny, a steamboat girl (Flash for Freedom!).\nLady Plunkett, wife of a colonial judge (not quite consummated: Flashman and the Angel of the Lord).\nHannah Popplewell, agent of a Southern slaveholders' conspiracy (Flashman and the Angel of the Lord).\nSara (Aunt Sara), sister-in-law of Count Pencherjevsky (Flashman at the Charge). Shares violent love-making with Flashman in a Russian steam-bath. Believed to be victim of a subsequent serf rising.\nSonsee-Array (Takes-Away-Clouds-Woman), an Apache savage 'princess', daughter of Mangas Coloradas (Flashman and the Redskins).\nMiranda Spring, daughter of John Charity Spring (Flashman and the Angel of the Lord).\nSzu-Zhan, a six-foot-eight Chinese bandit leader (Flashman and the Dragon).\nUliba-Wark, an Abyssinian chieftainess and warrior (Flashman on the March).\nValentina (Valla), married daughter of Russian nobleman and Cossack colonel Count Pencherjevsky (Flashman at the Charge). Has an affair with Flashman at her father's instigation. When charged with saving Valla from a rebellion of Pencherjevsky's serfs, Flashman attempts to escape pursuit by throwing her into the snow from a troika\nWhite Tigress and Honey-and-Milk, two concubines of the Chinese merchant Whampoa (Flashman's Lady).\nSusie Willinck (aka \"Miss Susie\"), New Orleans madam (Flash for Freedom! and Flashman and the Redskins).\nMadame Sabba, his \"guide\" at the Temple of Heaven, actually the lure in a robbery scheme (Flashman's Lady, unconsummated).\nMam'selle Bomfomtalbellilaba, a guest at one of Ranavalona I of Madagascar's parties (Flashman's Lady, unconsummated).\nHermia, an African slave (Flash for Freedom!).As well as bedding more or less any lass available, he married whenever it was politic to do so. During a posting to Scotland, he was forced to marry Elspeth to avoid \"pistols for two with her fire-breathing uncle\". He is still married to her decades later when writing the memoirs, though that does not stop him pursuing others. Nor does it prevent marrying them when his safety seems to require it; he marries Duchess Irma in Royal Flash and in Flashman and the Redskins he marries Susie Willnick as they escape New Orleans, and Sonsee-Array a few months later.\nHe was also once reminded of a woman that Elspeth claimed he flirted with named Kitty Stevens, though Flashman was unable to remember her.\nHe had a special penchant for royal ladies, and noted that his favourite amours (apart from his wife) were Lakshmibai, Ci Xi and Lola Montez: \"a Queen, an Empress, and the foremost courtesan of her time: I dare say I'm just a snob.\"  He also noted that, while civilized women were more than ordinarily partial to him, his most ardent admirers were among the savage of the species: \"Elspeth, of course, is Scottish.\"  And for all his raking, it was always Elspeth to whom he returned and who remained ultimately top of the list.\nHis lechery was so strong that it broke out even in the midst of rather hectic circumstances. While accompanying Thomas Henry Kavanagh on his daring escape from Lucknow, he paused for a quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.\nFlashman's relations with the highest-ranking woman of his era, Queen Victoria, are warm but platonic. He first meets her in 1842 when he receives a medal for his gallantry in Afghanistan and reflects on what a honeymoon she and Prince Albert must have enjoyed. Subsequently he and his wife received invitations to Balmoral Castle, to the delight of the snobbish Elspeth. For his services during the Indian Mutiny, Victoria not only approved awarding Flashy the Victoria Cross, but loaded the KCB on top of it.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n\n=== The Flashman Papers ===\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1975, Malcolm McDowell played Harry Flashman in Royal Flash, directed by Richard Lester.\n\n\n== References in other works ==\nIt is unclear whether Hughes or Fraser was aware of it, but the first occurrence of the name \"Flashman\" in fiction comes from the 2nd century, as an emissary of the Sun in Lucian's novel A True Story.\nIn the Jackson Speed Memoirs, Robert Peecher borrows heavily from George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman in creating the Jackson Speed character. Like Flashman, Speed is a womanizer and a coward who is undeservedly marked as a hero by those around him. Peecher also adopts the literary device used by Fraser of the \"discovered\" memoirs. Unlike the English Flashman, Speed is an American making appearances in the Mexican\u2013American War, the U.S. Civil War, and other American conflicts of the 19th century.\nWriter Keith Laidler gave the Flashman story a new twist in The Carton Chronicles by revealing that Flashman is the natural son of Sydney Carton, hero of the Charles Dickens classic A Tale of Two Cities. Laidler has Sydney Carton changing his mind at the foot of the guillotine, escaping death and making wayward and amorous progress through the terrors of the French Revolution, during which time he spies for both the British and French, causes Danton's death, shoots Robespierre, and reminisces on a liaison among the hayricks at the \"Leicestershire pile\" of a married noblewoman, who subsequently gave birth to a boy\u2014Flashman\u2014on 5 May 1822.\nSandy Mitchell's Warhammer 40,000 character Commissar Ciaphas Cain is partially inspired by Flashman.\nIn comics, writer John Ostrander took Flashman as his model for his portrayal of the cowardly villain Captain Boomerang in the Suicide Squad series. In the letters page to the last issue in the series (#66), Ostrander acknowledges this influence directly. Flashman's success with the ladies is noticeably lacking in the Captain Boomerang character.\nIn Kim Newman's alternative history novel The Bloody Red Baron (part of the Anno Dracula series), Flashman is cited as an example of a dishonourable officer in a character's internal monologue. In the later novella Aquarius (set in 1968, one year before the first volume of the Flashman Papers was published), it is mentioned that the fictional St Bartolph's College at the University of London had previously been home to the Harry Paget Flashman Refectory, until its recent renaming to Che Guevara Hall in an attempt to pacify campus activists.\nFlashman's portrait (unnamed, but with unmistakable background and characteristics) hangs in the home of the protagonist of The Peshawar Lancers, an alternative history novel by S. M. Stirling: the family claims to have had an ancestor who held Piper's Fort, as Flashman did; the protagonist claims his sole talents are for horsemanship and languages and has an Afghan in his service named \"Ibrahim Khan\" (cf. Ilderim Khan); late in the book, he plays with Elias the Jew on a \"black jade chess set\" matching the description of the one Flashman stole from the Summer Palace in Flashman and the Dragon; the book's chief antagonist is named Ignatieff. Another allusion to Flashman by Stirling occurs in his short story \"The Charge of Lee's Brigade\", which appeared in the alternative history anthology Alternate Generals (1998, ed. by Harry Turtledove). Here, Sir Robert E. Lee is a British general in the Crimean War who orders an officer, obviously Flashman (cherrypicker trousers, rides like a Comanche in battle), to take part in a better-planned Charge of the Light Brigade. Flashman dies in the attack, demonstrating some courage despite what Lee perceives only as nervousness. So, in this version Flashman again ends up a hero. But\u2014as he himself would have been quick to point out\u2014he is a dead hero.\nTerry Pratchett was a fan of the Flashman series and the Discworld character Rincewind is an inveterate coward with a talent for languages who is always running away from danger, but nevertheless through circumstance emerges with the appearance of an unlikely hero, for which reason he is then selected for further dangerous enterprises. In this he strongly resembles Flashman, although he is totally dissimilar in most other aspects. The word \"Rince\" means an object that moves quickly so \"Rincewind\" may be a play on the name the Apache gave to Flashman which was shortened to \"Windbreaker\" from the full \"White-Rider-Goes-So-Fast-He-Destroys-the-Wind-with-His-Speed\". The Discworld novel Pyramids has a character named Fliemoe, the bully at the Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild school, who is a parody of the original version of Flashman from Tom Brown's Schooldays (including \"toasting\" new boys). In the Assassins' Guild Yearbook and Diary, Fliemoe is described as having grown up to be \"an unbelievable liar and an unsuccessful bully\". His name is a play on that of Flashman's crony Speedicut\u2014both \"Speedicut\" and \"Flymo\" are brand names of British lawn mowers.\nAn editorial piece in the 14 May 2011 edition of The Guardian newspaper on the subject of British Prime Minister David Cameron being labelled a \"Flashman\" was given a Harry Flashman by-line and was written in the style of Flashman's narrative.\nFlashman's son, Harry II, is used as a character in some of the short stories created for the \"Tales of the Shadowmen\" series. He first appeared in the eighth volume. His son has several of the characteristics of his father, but appears to be less a coward.\nThe writing for Lord Flashheart, a minor character in Series 2 and 4 of Blackadder, seems likely to have been at least in part inspired by Flashman.\nFlashman appears as a minor character in the novel Dickens of the Mounted by Eric Nicol. This novel is a fictionalized account of Francis Dickens and, like the Flashman books, is written in the form of a discovered memoir.\nFlashman is a character in Snooks North and South and Snooks The Presidents' Man by Peter Brian. The protagonist of these books is Snooks, who is another character from Tom Brown's School Days. In Brian's books, Snooks participates in the American Civil War under disreputable circumstances and conceals his identity by using Harry Flashman's name. So the events that would be attributed to Flashman actually occurred to Snooks.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCannadine, David (9 December 2005). \"How I Inspired Thatcher\". BBC News.

        "article": "Mohammad Azharuddin (born 8 February 1963) also known as Azhar or Azzu among cricket fraternity, is an Indian politician, former cricketer. He is the Working President of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee. He was the Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha from Moradabad. Renowned as an elegant middle-order batsman and one of India's most successful captains, he played 99 tests and 334 one day matches for India. His international playing career came to an end when he was found to be involved in a match-fixing scandal in 2000 and subsequently banned by the BCCI for life. In 2012, the Andhra Pradesh High Court declared the life ban illegal.In 2009, Azharuddin was elected as a member of the Parliament from Moradabad on an Indian National Congress party ticket. In September 2019, Azharuddin was elected as the President of Hyderabad Cricket Association.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAzharuddin was born in Hyderabad to Mohammad Azizuddin and Yousuf Sultana. He attended All Saints High School, Hyderabad and graduated from Nizam College, Osmania University with a Bachelor of Commerce degree.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nBorn in the Nizam town of Hyderabad in the then state of Andhra Pradesh,(now Telangana).\nHe was known for his wristy strokeplay, much like Indian cricketer Vishwanath and Pakistani cricketer Zaheer Abbas. Azharuddin made his debut for the Indian cricket team in Test cricket in 1984 against England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 31 December 1984, where he scored 110 in his first innings from 322 deliveries, alongside Ravi Shastri who scored 111, in what was ultimately a drawn match. He subsequently scored two more centuries in his next two Test matches. He scored an aggressive 121 against England at Lord's in 1990. India was faced with the prospect of a follow-on when Azharuddin came in to bat at number five and scored his hundred off 88 balls in a losing cause. Former England cricketer Vic Marks called it \"the most dazzling Test century\" he had ever witnessed, in his column for the Observer. In the Second Test in Manchester, Azharuddin made 179 in reply to England's first innings total of 519. Playing attacking cricket, he made 103 runs off 107 balls between lunch and tea on day three, while putting on a 112-run stand with Sachin Tendulkar. Playing his 39th Test, he reached his 10th Test century off 155 balls. The match ended in a draw. Azharuddin ended the series with 426 runs at 85.20. This tally was the highest by an Asian captain in a Test series in England until 2018 when it was broken by Virat Kohli.Azharuddin scored a record-equalling century for an Indian player in the Second Test at Calcutta during South Africa's India tour in 1996\u201397. In reply to South Africa's first innings score of 428, Azharuddin brought up his century off 74 deliveries, equalling Kapil Dev's record for the fastest Test century by an India player and fourth overall, in terms of balls faced. Resuming batting on day three on the fall of Javagal Srinath's wicket after retiring hurt the previous evening, Azharuddin reached 50 in 35 balls, then the second fastest for India and scored 91 runs in the first session of play. He struck a 161-run partnership with Anil Kumble for the eighth wicket, another India national record, \"hooking and pulling\" while dealing with his \"weakness against the short-pitched delivery\". He particularly attacked Lance Klusener scoring 20 runs off his 14th over. It was his fourth century at this venue and 15th overall. However, India was handed one of its biggest defeats despite another attacking innings by Azharuddin in the fourth innings. Azharuddin followed this up with a second-innings century in the next Test, also the last, of the series. He made an unbeaten 163 and helped his team record their hitherto biggest win in Test history in terms of runs (280). He was named the man of the match, and the series. He aggregated 388 runs for the series at 77.60.Predominantly a middle-order batsman, Azharuddin was known for his attacking brand of cricket and strong slip catching, though continuously struggled against the short ball. Azharuddin played 99 test matches for India and scored 6,215 runs at an average of 45.03, including 22 centuries and 21 half-centuries. His record in ODIs was more impressive, with 9,378 runs from 334 matches at an average of 36.92. As a fielder, he took 156 catches in ODI cricket. Azharuddin started his career with a 110 against England in Kolkata in 1984 and ended with a 102 against South Africa in Banglaore in 2000 thus, becoming the only Indian and the fifth batsman ever to score a century in his first and last Test matches.\nAzharuddin was convicted of match-fixing in 2000, and banned for life by the BCCI. During India's 2000 tour of South Africa, a series that was won by India 3\u20132, Azharuddin scored 112 runs at an average of 28. Other key Indian cricketers whom Azharuddin groomed and also brought into the match-fixing fold displayed similarly dismal performances.\n\n\n=== Captaincy ===\nAzharuddin became the captain of the Indian team succeeding Krishnamachari Srikkanth in 1989. He led the Indian team in 47 Test matches and 174 One Day Internationals. He led the team to victory in 90 ODIs, the highest until surpassed by M.S. Dhoni on 2 September 2014. His 14 test match wins as captain was a record until it was beaten by Sourav Ganguly, who has 21 test match wins to his name.\n\n\n=== Match Fixing ===\nAzharuddin was convicted of match-fixing in the match-fixing scandal in 2000. The CBI report states that Azhar was the one to introduce then South African Captain, Hansie Cronje to the bookies. The ICC and the BCCI banned Azharuddin for life based on a report by K Madhavan of the Central Bureau of Investigation. On 8 November 2012, a Divisional Bench consisting of Justice Ashutosh Mohunta and Krishna Mohan Reddy of the Andhra Pradesh High Court revoked the ban imposed based on the evidence found,court verdicted that ban was illegal although Azhar never come back on field due to age,right now he is chairman of Hyderabad cricket board since 2019.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nAzharuddin was a middle-order batsman of India. He was known for a graceful and fluid batting style. John Woodcock, a cricket writer, said of him, \"It's no use asking an Englishman to bat like Mohammad Azharuddin. It would be like expecting a greyhound to win The Derby.\" Retired cricketer Venkataraghavan stated that \"Azharuddin had the best wrists in the game\". Mike Atherton and Angus Fraser said Azharuddin's \"genius was second only to Brian Lara among batsmen of their generation.\"Novelist and cricket historian Arunabha Sengupta said of Azharuddin:\n\n Mohammad Azharuddin, was one of the most delightful batsmen to watch and a superb fielder to boot, whose career ended under a cloud of allegations. Azhar was simply magical. Be it batting or fielding, his willow was a wand, his strokes cast a spell and his motion in the field was hypnotic.\n\n\n=== Test career statistics ===\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAzharuddin formally joined the Indian National Congress party on 19 February 2009. He won the 2009 Indian general election from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh to become Member of Parliament of India. Mohammed Azaharuddin had disclosed his intention to contest the 2019 elections from Secunderabad Parliamentary constituency in 2019.He is currently holding the position of Working President of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAzharuddin was awarded the Arjuna Award in 1986 and the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution in the field of sports, in 1988. He was named one of five Wisden's Cricketers of the Year for the year 1991.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAzharuddin married Naureen in 1987 and had two sons with her. In 1996, he divorced her and married actress Sangeeta Bijlani. The marriage reportedly ended in a divorce in 2010 due to Azhar's affair with badminton player Jwala Gutta. However the former captain claims he is still married to Sangeeta, dismissing rumors of his 3rd marriage.\nHe had 2 sons Asaduddin and Ayazuddin. His younger son Ayazuddin died in a road accident in 2011. A large number of VIP's, including the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy and other politicians arrived at the hospital to console Azhar and his family members.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA Bollywood film Azhar, directed by Tony D'Souza, was based on his life. The film featured Emraan Hashmi as Azharuddin, Nargis Fakhri as Sangeeta Bijlani and Prachi Desai as first wife Naureen. It was released on 13 May 2016. The film was criticized for whitewashing  his complicity in the match-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of international cricket centuries by Mohammad Azharuddin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammad Azharuddin at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Sunil Manohar Gavaskar (Marathi pronunciation: [suni\u02d0l \u0261a\u02d0\u028b\u0259sk\u0259\u027e]; pronunciation ; born 10 July 1949), is an Indian cricket commentator and former cricketer representing India and Bombay from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen and one of the best opening batsmen in Test cricket history, Gavaskar set world records during his career for the most Test runs and most Test centuries scored by any batsman. He held the record of 34 Test centuries for almost two decades before it was broken by Sachin Tendulkar in December 2005. He was the first person to score centuries in both innings of a Test match three times. He was the first Test batsman to score 10,000 Test runs in a career and now stands at number 12 on the group of 13 players with 10,000-plus Test runs.\nGavaskar was widely admired for his technique against fast bowling, with a particularly high average of 65.45 against the West Indies team, who possessed a four-pronged fast bowling attack regarded as the most vicious in Test history. However, most of Gavaskar's centuries against West Indies were against their second string team when their four-pronged attack were not playing.\nHis captaincy of the Indian team, however, was less successful. Turbulent performances of the team led to multiple exchanges of captaincy between Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, with one of Gavaskar's sackings coming just six months before Kapil led India to victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He is also a former Sheriff of Mumbai.\nGavaskar is a recipient of the Indian civilian honours of the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan. He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2012, he was awarded the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award for Cricket in India.\n\n\n== Domestic debut ==\nBorn in Mumbai in a middle class Marathi Family and a student of St Xavier's High School young Sunil Gavaskar was named India's Best Schoolboy Cricketer of the year in 1966 while playing for his school. He scored 246*, 222 and 85 in school cricket in his final year of secondary education before striking a century against the touring London schoolboys. He made his first-class debut for Vazir Sultan Colts XI against an XI from Dungarpur in 1966/67 but remained in Bombay's Ranji Trophy squad for the next two years without playing a match. An alumnus of Bombay's renowned St. Xavier's College, he made his debut in the 1968/69 season against Karnataka but made a duck and was the subject of derisive claims that his selection was due to the presence of his uncle Madhav Mantri, a former Indian Test wicket keeper on Bombay's selection committee. He responded with 114 against Rajasthan in his second match and two other consecutive centuries saw him being selected in the 1970/71 Indian team to tour the West Indies.\n\n\n== Test debut ==\n\n\n=== First test match win in West Indies ===\nAfter missing the first Test due to tooth infection, Gavaskar scored 65 and 67 not out in the second Test in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, hitting the winning runs which gave India its first-ever win over the West Indies.\n\n\n=== First Test century and first series victory over West Indies ===\nHe followed this with his first century, 116 and 64* in the third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, and 1 and 117* in the Fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados. He returned to Trinidad for the fifth Test and scored 124 and 220 to help India to its first ever series victory over the West Indies, and the only one until 2006. His performance in the Test made him the second player after Doug Walters to score a century and double century in the same match and remains the only Indian till date to achieve this feat. He also became the first Indian to make four centuries in one Test series, the second Indian after Vijay Hazare to score two centuries in the same Test, and the third after Hazare and Polly Umrigar to score centuries in three consecutive innings. He was the first Indian to aggregate more than 700 runs in a series and till date remains the only Indian to do so. This 774 runs at 154.80 also remains the most runs scored in a debut series by any batsman. Trinidad Calypso singer Lord Relator (Willard Harris) wrote a song in Gavaskar's honour, the \"Gavaskar Calypso\".\n\n\n=== England tour ===\nGavaskar's arrival in England in 1971 for a three-Test series generated substantial publicity in light of his debut series. He was unable to maintain his performance, making only two half-centuries. He was involved in controversy when taking a quick single from the bowling of John Snow. They collided, and Gavaskar fell over. Snow was charged with deliberately barging into Gavaskar and was suspended. Gavaskar's 144 runs at the low average of 24, led some to question Gavaskar's worthiness for international cricket.\n\n\n=== England tour of India ===\nIn 1972\u201373, England toured India for a five-Test series, Gavaskar's first on home soil. He was ineffective in the first three Tests, accumulating only sixty runs in five innings as India took a 2\u20131 lead. He scored some runs in the final two Tests which India drew to complete consecutive series wins over England. His first home series was largely disappointing, aggregating 224 runs at 24.89. His English critics were placated when India returned in 1974 and Gavaskar scored 101 and 58 in the second Test at Old Trafford. He managed 227 runs at 37.83 as India were whitewashed 3\u20130.\n\n\n=== West Indies tour ===\nGavaskar's 1974\u201375 series against the West Indies was interrupted, playing in only the First and fifth and final Test of the series against the West Indies. He scored 108 runs at 27, with an 86 bowled by Lance Gibbs at Bombay's Wankhede Stadium hosting the first test on this ground, the closest the Indian public got to see a century. The Test was the start of a world record streak of 106 Test appearances.The 1975\u201376 season saw three and four Test tours of New Zealand and the West Indies, respectively. Gavaskar led India in a Test for the first time in January 1976 against New Zealand during the First Test in Auckland when regular captain Bishen Singh Bedi was suffering from a leg injury. Standing in despite having scored only 703 runs at 28.12 since his debut series, Gavaskar rewarded the selectors with 116 and 35*. As a result, India secured an eight-wicket victory. He ended the series with 266 runs at 66.33. On the West Indian leg of the tour, Gavaskar scored consecutive centuries of 156 and 102 in the Second and Third Tests, both in Port of Spain, Trinidad. These were his third and fourth centuries at the grounds. In the Third Test, his 102 helped India post 4/406 to set a world record for the highest winning fourth innings score. The Indians' mastery of the Caribbean spinners on a turning track reportedly led West Indian captain Clive Lloyd to vow that he would rely on pace alone in future Tests. Gavaskar totalled 390 runs at 55.71 for the series.\n\n\n=== First home test century ===\nGavaskar was not to score a century on home soil until November 1976. In an eight-Test season, three and five against New Zealand and England, respectively, Gavaskar scored centuries in the first and last Tests of the season. The first was 119 in front of his home crowd at the Wankhede Stadium, helping India to a victory. Gavaskar scored another half-century in the Second Test to end the series with 259 at 43.16. In the First Test against England at Delhi, he was mobbed upon becoming the first Indian to reach 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year. A steady series saw him finish with 394 runs at 39.4 with a century coming in the Fifth Test and two half-centuries.\n\n\n=== Tour of Australia ===\nIn 1977\u201378 he toured Australia, scoring three consecutive Test centuries (113, 127, 118) in the second innings of the first three Tests at Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne, respectively. India won the third but lost the earlier two. He finished the Five Test series with 450 runs at 50, failing twice as India lost the final Test and the series 3\u20132.\n\n\n=== India Tour of Pakistan ===\n1978\u201379 saw India tour Pakistan for the first series between the arch-rivals for 17 years. For the first time, Gavaskar faced Pakistani pace spearhead Imran Khan, who described him as \"The most compact batsman I've bowled to.\" Gavaskar scored 89 in the First Test and 97 in the Second, which India drew and lost, respectively. Gavaskar saved his best for the Third Test in Karachi, scoring 111 and 137 in the Third, but was unable to prevent a defeat and series loss. His twin centuries made him the first Indian to score two centuries in one Test on two occasions, and saw him pass Umrigar as India's leading Test run-scorer. Gavaskar finished the series with 447 runs at 89.40.\n\n\n== Captaincy ==\nGavaskar was captain of the Indian team on several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although his record is less than impressive. Often equipped with unpenetrative bowling attacks he tended to use conservative tactics which resulted in a large number of draws. During his tenure, Kapil Dev emerged as a leading pace bowler for the country. He captained India to nine victories and eight losses, but most of the games were drawn, 30.\n\n\n=== First test series as a captain ===\nHis first series in charge was a West Indian visit to India for a six Test series. Gavaskar's several large centuries contrasted with several failures. His 205 in the First Test made him the first Indian to score a double century in India against the West Indies. He added a further 73 in the second innings of a high scoring draw. After failing to score in the Second Test, he scored 107 and 182 not out in the Third Test at Calcutta, another high scoring draw. This made him the first player in Test history to achieve centuries in both innings of a Test three times. He managed only 4 and 1 in the Fourth Test in Madras as India forced the only win of the series. He posted a fourth century for the series, scoring 120 in the Fifth Test at Delhi, becoming the first Indian to pass 4000 Test runs. He aggregated 732 runs at 91.50 for the series, securing India a 1\u20130 win in his first series as captain.\n\n\n=== Stripped of the captaincy ===\nDespite this, he was stripped of the captaincy when India toured England in 1979 for a four Test tour. The official reason given was that Srinivas Venkataraghavan was preferred due to his superior experience on English soil, but most observers believed that Gavaskar was punished because he was believed to be considering defecting to World Series Cricket. He started consistently, scoring four half-centuries in five innings of the first three Tests. It was in the Fourth Test at The Oval that he produced his finest innings on English soil. India was 1\u20130 down needed to reach a world record target of 438 to square the series. They reached 76/0 at stumps on the fourth day. Led by Gavaskar, India made steady progress to be 328/1 with 20 overs remaining on the final day with a record-breaking victory still possible. An Ian Botham led fightback saw Gavaskar removed, with India still needing 49 runs from 46 balls. With three balls left in the match, all four results were possible. India ended nine runs short with two wickets in hand when stumps were drawn. According to Sanjay Manjrekar, it was \"Vintage Gavaskar, playing swing bowling to perfection, taking his time initially and then opening up. Nothing in the air, everything copybook.\" He ended the series with 542 runs at 77.42 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\n\n\n=== Restored to captaincy ===\nGavaskar was restored to the captaincy for the gruelling 1979\u201380 season, with six Test home series against both Australia and Pakistan. The first two Tests against Australia were high scoring draws where only 45 wickets fell, with India taking a first-innings lead in both after making scores over 400. India broke through for a 153-run win in the Third Test at Kanpur, where Gavaskar scored 76. He made 115 in the Fourth Test in Delhi, where India were unable to convert a 212-run first innings lead, resulting in a draw. After another stalemate in the Fifth Test, Gavaskar scored 123 in the Sixth Test, where Australia collapsed by an innings after India posted their fourth first innings in excess of 400 for the series. The series against Pakistan was similarly high scoring, with four draws, three of which did not reach the fourth innings. India won the Third and Fifth Tests in Bombay and Madras. At Madras, he made 166 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 29 when India brought up the winning runs. Having secured the series 2\u20130, Gavaskar was removed from the captaincy for the drawn Sixth Test. This occurred because Gavaskar had refused to tour the West Indies for another series immediately afterwards, asking for a rest. As a result, Gundappa Viswanath was appointed so that he could prepare his leadership skills for the tour. In the end the tour did not go ahead as the West Indian board were not interested in a team without Gavaskar. The season ended with a one-off Test against England in Bombay, which India lost. In the 13 Tests that season, he made 1027 runs at 51.35 with three centuries and four half-centuries. This ended a 14-month span in which Gavaskar played in 22 Tests and the 1979 Cricket World Cup. In that time, he scored 2301 Test runs including eight centuries.\n\n\n=== Australian Tour ===\nThe 1980\u201381 season saw Gavaskar returned as captain for the Australasian tour, but it was to be the start of an unhappy reign for Gavaskar and India. He managed only 118 runs at 19.66 in the three Tests against Australia, but his impact in Australia was for a controversial incident. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, when Gavaskar was given out by the Australian umpire Rex Whitehead , he ordered his fellow opener Chetan Chauhan off the field. Instead of abandoning the match, the Indian manager, SK Durani persuaded Chauhan to return to the match which India went on to win by 59 runs as Australia collapsed to 83 in their second innings. India drew the series 1\u20131 but the following three-Test series in New Zealand was to signal the start of a barren run of 19 Tests under Gavaskar of which India were to win only one and lose five. India lost to New Zealand 1\u20130, with Gavaskar managing 126 runs at 25.2. He finished the Oceania tour with 244 runs at 22.18, with only two half-centuries, making little impact.\n\n\n=== England in India ===\nThe 1981\u201382 Indian season saw a hard-fought 1\u20130 series win over England in six Tests. India took the First Test, before five consecutive draws resulted, four of which did not even reach the fourth innings. Gavaskar made 172 in the Second Test at Bangalore and reached a half-century on three further occasions to compile 500 runs at 62.5. India reciprocated England's visit in 1982 for a three-Test series, which was lost 1\u20130. Gavaskar made 74 runs at 24.66 but was unable to bat in the Third Test.\n\n\n=== Sri Lanka Tour ===\nThe 1982\u201383 subcontinental season started well for Gavaskar on an individual note, as he made 155 in a one-off Test against Sri Lanka in Madras. It was the first Test between the two nations, with Sri Lankan having only recently been awarded Test status. Despite this, India were unable to finish off their novice opponents, the draw heralding a start of a winless summer. India played in twelve Tests, losing five and drawing seven. The first series was a six Test tour to Pakistan. India started well enough, drawing the First Test in Lahore, with Gavaskar scoring 83. Pakistan then defeated India in three consecutive matches. In the Third Test in Faisalabad, Gavaskar managed an unbeaten 127 in the second innings to force Pakistan into a run chase, but the other two losses were substantial, both by an innings. Despite holding on for draws in the last two Tests, Gavaskar was replaced by Kapil Dev as captain after the 3\u20130 loss. Despite his team's difficulties, Gavaskar remained productive with 434 runs at 47.18 with a century and three half centuries. Gavaskar went on to the West Indies for a five Test tour purely as a batsman, but could not reproduce the form that he had shown in the Caribbean in 1971 and 1976. He managed only 240 runs at 30, as India were crushed 2\u20130 by the world champions. Apart from an unbeaten 147 in the drawn Third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, his next best effort was 32.The 1983\u201384 season started with a home series against Pakistan, with all three matches being drawn. Gavaskar scored an unbeaten 103 in the First Test in Bangalore, and made two further half centuries to total 264 runs at 66.\n\n\n=== Overtaking Bradman's test record ===\nThe Pakistan series was followed by a six Test series against the touring West Indies at the height of their powers. The First Test was held in Kanpur and India were crushed by an innings. Gavaskar had his bat knocked out of his hand by a hostile delivery from Malcolm Marshall before being dismissed. In the Second Test in Delhi, Gavaskar delivered his riposte to Marshall, hooking him for a consecutive four and six to start his innings. Gavaskar, unwilling to be dictated to by the Caribbean pacemen, hooked the short-pitched barrage relentlessly, reaching his half century in 37 balls. He then went on to score 121, his 29th Test century in 94 balls in his 95th test match, equalling Don Bradman's world record. He also passed 8,000 Test runs in the innings, and was personally honoured by Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India at the ground. The match was drawn. Gavaskar's 90 in the Third Test at Ahmedabad saw him pass Geoff Boycott's Test world record of 8,114 career runs, but was insufficient to prevent another defeat. During the Fifth Test in the series, India were defeated by an innings at Calcutta to concede a 3\u20130 series lead. India had won only one of their 32 most recent Tests and none of their last 28. The crowd singled out Gavaskar, who had made a golden duck and 20. Angry spectators pelted objects onto the playing arena and clashed with police, before stoning the team bus. In the Sixth Test in Madras, he compiled his 30th Test century in his 99th test match, with an unbeaten 236 which was the highest Test score by an Indian. It was his 30th Test century and third double century against the West Indies, propelling him to overtake Donald Bradman's 29 test centuries record. He scored a total of 505 runs at an average of 50.50 for the series.\n\n\n=== Failure to win for successive Tests ===\nWith India having failed to win for 29 successive Tests, Kapil was sacked as captain and Gavaskar resumed leadership at the start of the 1984\u201385 season. The two Test tour of Pakistan resulted in two further draws, with Gavaskar compiling 120 runs at 40. The First Test against England saw India break through for its first Test victory in 32 matches. It proved to be a false dawn, with England squaring the series 1\u20131 in Delhi before another controversial Third Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. The hostile crowd watched as India batted for over two days to reach 7/437 after 203 overs. Angry with the slow pace of India's innings, the crowd chanted \"Gavaskar down! Gavaskar out!\" blaming him for India' performance. The local police chief reportedly asked Gavaskar to declare to placate the angry crowd. When Gavaskar led his team onto the field, he was pelted with fruit.\nGavaskar vowed never to play at Eden Gardens again, and duly withdrew from the team for India's next fixture at the Bengali capital two years later, ending his record of 106 consecutive Tests. The match was drawn, but India conceded the series after losing the Fourth. The series ended 1\u20132, and with a poor display of 140 runs at 17.5, Gavaskar resigned, although he had already announced his intention to relinquish the leadership before the series. The change of captain improved the form of neither Gavaskar nor India as they toured Sri Lanka for a three-Test series. India were embarrassed 1\u20130 by the Test minnows at the time, with Gavaskar managing only 186 runs at 37.2.\n\n\n== International farewell ==\nIn 1985\u201386, India toured Australia, playing against a team in a poor form slump. India were unable to capitalise as all three Tests were drawn, but Gavaskar did. He scored an unbeaten 166 in the First Test in Adelaide and 172 in the Third Test in Sydney, ending the series with 352 runs at 117.33. A three-Test tour of England saw him score only 185 runs at 30.83, which India won 2\u20130 despite his unproductivity. In 1986\u201387, Gavaskar's final season in Test cricket, India faced a long season of eleven home Tests. Against a team regarded as the worst to leave Australian shores, Gavaskar made 90 in the second innings of the First Test in Madras (now Chennai), giving India a chance to reach the target of 348, which ended in a tie. He scored 103 in the Third Test to end the series with 205 runs at 51.66. The First Test against Sri Lanka in Kanpur saw Gavaskar's 34th and final Test century of 176. He scored 74 and 5 in the next two Tests as India won the three-match series 2\u20130. The five-Test series against arch enemies Pakistan was to be his last. Gavaskar scored 91 in the drawn First Test in Madras before withdrawing from the Second Test in Calcutta as he had promised. In the Fourth Test in Ahmedabad, Gavaskar's 63 made him the first batsman to pass 10,000 runs. With the teams locked 0\u20130 leading into the final Test in Bangalore, there was to be no fairytale. Gavaskar was dismissed for 96 in the second innings as India were bowled out to give Pakistan a 1\u20130 series win.Gavaskar rounded out his international career with the 1987 Cricket World Cup. He scored 300 runs at an average of 50 at the tournament. Against New Zealand in the league phase he recorded his highest ODI score of 103*. The good form however did not continue into the semifinals where Phil Defreitas bowled him for 4 runs  in his last international innings.\n\n\n== Style ==\nGavaskar was also a fine slip fielder and his safe catching in the slips helped him become the first Indian (excluding wicket-keepers) to take over a hundred catches in Test matches. In one ODI against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985, he took four catches and helped India defend a small total of 125. Early in his Test career, when India rarely used pace bowlers, Gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing, before a three-pronged spin attack took over. The only wicket claimed by him is that of Pakistani Zaheer Abbas in 1978\u201379.\nWhile Gavaskar could not be described as an attacking batsman, he had the ability of keeping the scoreboard ticking with unique shots such as the \"late flick\". His focus of technical correctness over flair meant that his style of play was usually less suited to the shorter form of the game, at which he had less success. His infamous 36 not out in the 1975 World Cup, carrying his bat through the full 60 overs against England, led Indian supporters to storm the field and confront him for scoring so slowly when India needed nearly a run a ball to win; at the end of the game India had lost only three wickets but scored 200 runs less than England. Gavaskar almost went through his career without scoring a one-day century. He managed his first (and only ODI century) in the 1987 World Cup, when he hit 103 not out in 88 balls against New Zealand in his penultimate ODI innings at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur.\n\n\n== Records and achievements ==\nGavaskar was the first Test cricket player to make over 10,000 runs.\nHe held the record for the highest number of test centuries (34) before Sachin Tendulkar went past him in 2005.\nHe has scored the highest runs (774) in a series as a debutant.\nHe has scored the most runs by any player in a series (774) against West Indies.\nHe has the maximum no. of runs & centuries scored by a player against West Indies\u20142,749 runs & 13 centuries.\nHe is the only cricketer to score 4 consecutive centuries at 2 venues \u2014 Port of Spain & Wankhede Stadium.\nHe is the only cricketer with Test century partnerships with 18 different players.\nHe is a joint holder of the record for scoring centuries in both innings of a Test Match on three occasions along with Australia's Ricky Ponting and David Warner.\nHe also became the first Indian fielder (excluding wicket-keepers) to get over a hundred catches in Test cricket.\nHe captained the national team on and off over a period between 1978 and 1985, which included a great 2\u20130 win over Pakistan in 1979/80.\nHe is the first Indian cricketer to carry his bat in test cricket, with a score of 127 not out in the Faisalabad Test in the year 1983.\nHe was named one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in 1980.\n\n\n== Important statistics ==\nTest debut: West Indies v India at Port of Spain, 6\u201310 March 1971\nLast Test: India v Pakistan at Bangalore, 13\u201317 March 1987\nODI debut: England v India at Leeds, 13 July 1974\nLast ODI: India v England at Bombay, 5 November 1987\nFirst-class span: 1966\u20131987\nFirst Class Debut: Vazir Sultan Colt's XI v Dungarpur XI at Hyderabad, 1966/67\nLast First Class Match: Rest of the World v M.C.C. at Lord's, 1987\nWisden Cricketer of the Year 1980\nList A span: 1973\u20131988 \nGavaskar's 100s in first class cricket.\nTests: 34,\nRanji Trophy: 20,\nIrani Cup: 3,\nDuleep Trophy: 6,\nRest of the World against England (his last first class game): 1,\nCounty cricket for Somerset: 2,\nOther games: 15.Sachin Tendulkar equalled Sunil Gavaskar's record of first class 100s on 8 February 2013 \nGavaskar was the first cricketer to play 100 consecutive test matches.\n\n\n== After playing career ==\n\nAfter retirement, he has been a popular, if sometimes controversial commentator, both on TV and in print. In 2003, he became the first Indian to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture. He also served as an advisor to the India national cricket team during the home series against Australia in 2004. He was the Chairman of the ICC cricket committee until the time he was forced to choose between commenting and being on the committee. He left the committee to continue his career as a broadcaster.The inaugural Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi Memorial Lecture was given by Gavaskar on 20 February 2013 at Taj Coromandel, Chennai.On 28 March 2014 the Supreme Court of India appointed Gavaskar as the interim President of the BCCI, primarily to oversee the seventh Season of the Indian Premier League. At the same time the Court directed him to give up his job as a commentator.Gavaskar joined Triton Solar as its Brand Ambassador.\n\n\n== Entertainment career ==\nGavaskar also tried his hand at acting on the silver screen. He played the lead role in the Marathi movie \"Savli Premachi\". The movie did not receive much appreciation though. After many years he appeared in a guest role in (1988) Hindi movie \"Maalamaal\".  with Naseeruddin Shah and Satish Shah. He has sung a Marathi song \"Ya Duniyemadhye Thambayaala Vel Konala\" which was written by noted Marathi lyricist Shantaram Nandgaonkar.The song depicted the similarities between a cricket match and real life.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1980, Gavaskar received the Padma Bhushan award for his successful International career representing Team India from the former Indian President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.\nOn 22 December 1994, Gavaskar was sworn in as Bombay Sheriff\u2014an honorary post, for a year, at Raj Bhavan in Mumbai in the presence of former Governor P C Alexander and former Chief minister Sharad Pawar.\nIn 1996, The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has been instituted in his co-honour. It was decided that any bilateral Test series between India and Australia will be called as Border-Gavaskar Trophy, named after iconic players Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar. Both these players scored more than 10,000 runs in their respective Test careers and captained their teams.\n\"Gavaskar Stadium\" in his home district of Vengurla has been named after him.\nIn 2003, he became the first and till now the only Indian to have delivered a MCC Spirit Of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture. He was the 3rd lecturer in the history of the Cowdrey lecture.\nOn 21 November 2012, Gavaskar was conferred with BCCI's prestigious Col. CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award at the BCCI Annual Awards Function 2011-12. The Lifetime Achievement Award given to Gavaskar carried a citation, trophy and a cheque for \u20b92.5 million (equivalent to \u20b93.8 million or US$53,000 in 2019) and he received this award from then BCCI president N. Srinivasan.\nOn 15 October 2017, Gavaskar inaugurated a cricket field in Louisville in the state of Kentucky in United States, thus making it the first international sporting facility named after an Indian sportsperson. The \"Sunil M. Gavaskar Cricket Field\", serves as the home ground for the Louisville Cricket Club, which is part of the 42-team MidWest Cricket League. Gavaskar was presented the keys of the ground by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.\n\n\n== Written works ==\nGavaskar wrote four books on cricket, including his own autobiography \n\nSunny Days: An Autobiography, 1976\nIdols, 1983\nRuns 'n' Ruins, 1984\nOne Day Wonders, 1986\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nOn 25 March 2008, Malcolm Speed, ICC chief executive, told Gavaskar \"very clearly\", during a meeting between the two at Dubai, that he would have to quit his post at the ICC if he failed to give up his job of commentator and newspaper columnist, in which capacity he has frequently criticised his employers and levelled serious accusations of racism. He sparked a controversy in early 2008 for his comments on the contentious Sydney Test Match: \"Millions of Indians want to know if it (match referee Mike Procter's verdict against Harbhajan Singh) was a 'white man' taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'. Quite simply, if there was no audio evidence, nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand.\" Despite the fact that Gavaskar's comment referenced Mike Procter and not the ICC, Australian writer Gideon Haigh said that, if Gavaskar genuinely believed this, \"then he should almost certainly resign, for if the ICC is a bastion of 'white man's justice', Gavaskar bears some of the blame for having failed to change it. He has been selected as the interim president of BCCI, replacing N. Srinivasan\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBorn in a Marathi speaking family to Meenal (n\u00e9e Mantri) & Manohar Gavaskar, Gavaskar is married to Marshneill Gavaskar (n\u00e9e Mehrotra), daughter of a leather industrialist from Kanpur. Their son, Rohan, was also a cricketer who played 11 One Day Internationals for India, but could not cement his spot in the team. Rohan was given the name \"Rohan Jaivishwa\" by his father as a tribute to his 3 favourite cricketers\u2014Rohan Kanhai; M. L. Jaisimha; and Rohan's uncle, Gundappa Vishwanath\u2014although his name is usually recorded as Rohan Sunil Gavaskar.\nSunil Gavaskar was exchanged with a fisherman's baby at birth. It was his Uncle who spotted that the child was not Sunny as he had a birthmark near his ear. \"Perhaps, I would have grown up to be an obscure fisherman, toiling somewhere along the west coast,\" Sunny G wrote.His maternal uncle was retired Indian cricketer Madhav Mantri. His sister Kavita Viswanath is married to cricketer Gundappa Viswanath. His other sister\u2014Nutan Gavaskar was the honorary general secretary of Women's Cricket Association of India (WCAI).Gavaskar is an ardent devotee of Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA bollywood film tittled 83 is scheduled to release in 2021 about the event of India's first world cup win at Lords.

Dev achieved his then best innings haul of 8/20 in just 9 overs in the second innings to skittle Bengal for 58 runs in under 19 overs. Haryana lost to Bombay in the quarter-finals.\nHe began his 1977\u201378 season claiming 8/38 in the first innings against Services. With 3 wickets in the second innings, he took his maiden 10-wicket haul in first-class cricket, a feat he would later achieve twice in Test cricket. With 23 wickets in 4 matches, he was selected for the Irani Trophy, Duleep Trophy and Wills Trophy matches.\nIn the 1978\u201379 season, Haryana had a repeat encounter with Bengal in the pre-quarterfinal match after a lackluster season from Dev (12 wickets from 4 matches). He scored 2 half-centuries in the group stage matches. In the pre-quarterfinal match, he took a 5-wicket haul in the first innings. Poor batting by Haryana in the second innings let Bengal avenge their loss from 2 seasons back by scoring the required 161 runs for the loss of just 4 wickets. Dev stood out in the Irani Trophy match, scoring 62 runs and coming in at number 8. He took 5 catches in the game where Karnataka was defeated by the Rest of India XI. Dev arrived in the national spotlight with a standout performance in the finals of the Duleep Trophy, taking a first-innings haul of 7/65 in 24 overs. He was included in the North Zone squad for Deodhar Trophy and Wills Trophy for the first time. He played his first Test match in the season against Pakistan.\nIn the 1979\u201380 season, Dev showed his batting talent with a maiden century against Delhi when he scored his career-best 193. In the pre-quarterfinal match, where he captained Haryana for the first time against Uttar Pradesh, he took a five-wicket haul in the second innings to advance to quarterfinals, where they lost to Karnataka. With Dev cementing his place in the Indian national squad, his appearances in domestic matches dwindled.\n\n\n==== 1990\u201391 Ranji champions ====\nIn the 1990\u201391 Ranji season, Haryana rode into the semi-finals on the back of the bowling performance of Chetan Sharma and the batting performance of Amarjit Kaypee. Dev took centre stage in the semi-final against Bengal, where he led his team to a Mammoth score of 605 runs by scoring 141 as well as taking 5 wickets.\nThe finals of the 1991 season will be remembered for the number of international cricketers who participated, including Kapil Dev, Chetan Sharma, Ajay Jadeja and Vijay Yadav turning up for Haryana and Bombay cricket team represented by Sanjay Manjrekar, Vinod Kambli, Sachin Tendulkar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Chandrakant Pandit, Salil Ankola and Abey Kuruvilla. Deepak Sharma (199), Ajay Jadeja (94) and Chetan Sharma (98) helped Haryana to a score of 522 while Yogendra Bhandari (5 wickets) and Dev (3 wickets) restricted Bombay to 410 runs in the first innings. A crucial 41 from Dev and top scorer Banerjee (60) took Haryana to 242 runs, setting Bombay a target of 355 runs. After the initial wickets, Vengsarkar (139) and Tendulkar (96) fought back for the Bombay team. After Tendulkar's dismissal, Haryana took the final 6 wickets for 102 runs and Vengsarkar and Bombay were stranded 3 runs short of the target. Dev won his maiden and only Ranji Trophy championship.\n\n\n==== County stint ====\nKapil Dev represented the county Northamptonshire for the seasons 1981, 1982 and 1983 and later played for Worcestershire between 1984 and 1985 seasons. Kapil played a total of 40 first-class matches in his county stint and made 2,312 runs across 64 innings with four centuries and 14 half-centuries. Out of his 835 overall first-class wickets, 103 of those wickets came during his stint with those two county teams.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1978\u20131982) ===\nDev made his Test cricket debut in Faisalabad, Pakistan on 16 October 1978. Although his match figures were unimpressive, the numbers did not convey any measure of his contribution. He startled the Pakistani batsmen with his pace and bouncers that struck their helmets on more than one occasion. Dev captured his maiden wicket of Sadiq Mohammad with his trademark outswinger. He showcased his all-rounder talent when he scored India's fastest Test half-century off 33 balls and 2 sixes in each of the innings during the 3rd Test match at National Stadium, Karachi, although India lost the match and the series 2\u20130. In the ensuing series against a visiting West Indies team, he scored his maiden Test century (126) at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi in just 124 balls and had a steady bowling performance (17 wickets at 33.00). Ominous signs of Dev's liking for England showed up in the ensuring series, his first outside the sub-continent. He picked up his first 5-wicket haul and all of England's wickets, although it came at a huge cost (48 overs and 146 runs conceded) as England scored a mammoth 633 and won the match comfortably. Dev finished the series with 16 wickets though his batting haul of 45 runs (Average: 7.5) was unimpressive. His debut in ODI Cricket happened in the earlier tour of Pakistan where his individual performance was ordinary and it stayed the same as both Dev and India had a poor campaign at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.\nDev established himself as India's premier fast bowler when he took two 5-wicket hauls and ended the home series against Australia with 28 wickets (Average: 22.32) and also 212 runs that included a half-century. He gained fame in the 6-Test home series against Pakistan in the 1979\u201380 season when he led India to 2 victories against the visitors \u2013 once with the bat (69) at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay and the second time with bat and ball (10-wicket haul in match \u2013 4/90 in the first innings and 7/56 in the second innings, 84 in 98 balls with his bat) at Chepauk, Madras (Now Chennai). Dev rates his all-round performance in this match as his career best and his second innings figure of 7/56 was his best to-date. During the series, he also became the youngest Test player to achieve the all-round double of 100 Wickets and 1000 Runs and in 25 matches (although Ian Botham took just 21 matches to achieve the same feat) and finished the series with 32 wickets (Ave: 17.68) and 278 runs that included 2 fifties.\n\nIndia's tour of Australia in 1980\u201381 had the looks of the familiar Indian series as India were 1\u20130 down and were defending a meagre 143 runs and Dev virtually ruled out with a groin injury. When Australia finished the fourth day at 18/3, Dev willed himself to play the final day with pain-killing injections and removed the dangerous Australia middle order. Dev won the match for India with the innings bowling performance of 16.4\u20134\u201328\u20135, a bowling performance that figures in his five best bowling performance. During the Australian tour, he scored his first fifty in ODIs against New Zealand at Brisbane. Somehow India's Test cricket sensation was unable to adjust to ODI cricket and had a career start of 278 runs (Average: 17.38) and 17 wickets after 16 ODI matches.\nA dismal New Zealand tour later, Dev was ready for the 1981\u201382 home series against England where his five-wicket haul won the first test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay. He scored 318 runs (Average: 53, 1 century, 1 fifty) and took 22 wickets (2 5-wicket hauls) and walked away with the Man of the Series honours. England saw more of Dev in the ensuing series at home against the Indian cricket team in the 1982 season when he opened with a 5-wicket haul and 130 runs in a losing cause at Lord's. He finished the 3-match series with 292 runs (Ave: 73, 3 fifties) and 10 Wickets and bagged the Man of the Series again.Facing Sri Lanka for the first time, Dev helped himself to a five-wicket haul to kick start the 1982\u201383 season. In the following tour to Pakistan, Dev and Mohinder Amarnath were the only bright spots in a series dominated by rival all-rounder Imran Khan (40 wickets and 1 century). Dev took a 5/102 haul in the second Test at National Stadium, Karachi, 7/220 in the third Test at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad and 8/85 at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore while he received little support from other team members. After this disastrous tour, Dev was made the captain of the Indian cricket team in place of Sunil Gavaskar.\n\n\n=== Captain: 1983 World Cup Champions (1982\u20131984) ===\nDev debuted as India's captain in the 1982\u201383 season against Sri Lanka (before the Pakistan tour) when Gavaskar was rested. His first assignment as regular captain was the tour of West Indies, where the biggest accomplishment was a lone ODI victory. Dev (72) and Gavaskar (90) led India to a huge score \u2013 282/5 in 47 overs and Dev's 2 wickets aided India to restrict West Indies for 255 and a victory that Indian cricketers claim gave them the confidence to face the West Indies team in 1983 Cricket World Cup. Overall, Dev had a good series in West Indies as he scored a century to save the second test match as well as picking up 17 wickets (Average: 24.94).\n\n\n==== 1983 World Cup performance ====\nDev entered the World Cup with an ordinary individual record \u2013 32 Matches, 608 Runs (Average: 21), 34 wickets. India's solitary victory in the previous two World Cups was against East Africa in 1975. Riding on Yashpal Sharma (89 Runs), Roger Binny and Ravi Shastri (3 wickets each), India inflicted the West Indies' first-ever defeat in the World Cup. Following a victory against Zimbabwe, India lost the next two matches \u2013 Australia (despite Dev's best career figures of 5/43) and West Indies. India now needed victories against Australia and Zimbabwe to advance to the semifinals.\nIndia faced Zimbabwe at Nevill Ground, Royal Tunbridge Wells on 18 June 1983. After falling behind, Dev, batting with the lower order batsmen, stabilised the side with help from Roger Binny (22 runs) and Madan Lal. Dev scored his century off 100 balls. Together with Kirmani (22 runs), Dev put on an unbeaten 126 runs for the 9th wicket \u2013 a world record that stood unbroken for 27 years (10,000 days), and finished not out with 175 runs off 138 balls, an innings that included 16 boundaries and 6 sixes. The innings figures in the Top 10 ODI Batting Performances at No. 4. India won the match by 31 runs. It's said that after this match, Dev booked a Mercedes for himself as a reward.\nIn the semifinals India faced the English cricket team. Dev helped curtail the lower order after England lost regular wickets to Binny and Amarnath. He took 3 wickets as India limited England to 213 and the middle order of Amarnath (46 runs), Yashpal Sharma (61) and Sandeep Patil (51*) ensured victory and entry into the finals to take on the West Indies cricket team who were looking for a hat-trick of World Cup titles. West Indies restricted India for 183 runs, with only Krishnamachari Srikkanth (38 runs) providing some scoring relief. Despite losing Gordon Greenidge, West Indies steadied their innings to 57/2 on the back of quick scoring by Viv Richards. Richards played one too many aggressive shots when he skied a pull shot from Madan Lal that Dev caught at deep square leg after running backwards for over 20 yards. The catch is attributed as the turning point in the 1983 WC Final and is regarded as one of the finest in ODI Cricket. West Indies collapsed from 50/1 to 76/6 and finally were bowled out for 140 with Dev picking up the wicket of Andy Roberts. The win was India's maiden World Cup and he led with 303 runs (Average: 60.6), 12 wickets (Average: 20.41) and 7 catches in 8 matches.\n\n\n=== Post-World Cup ===\nAfter the World Cup, India hosted the West Indies cricket team and lost the Test series 3\u20130 and the ODI Series 5\u20130. Dev achieved his best test bowling performance in a loss at Motera Stadium, Ahmedabad with a return of 9/83. His bowling performance in the test and ODI series was let down by his poor batting performance. The selectors ended Dev's reign by reappointing Gavaskar as captain in early 1984.\n\n\n=== Return to captaincy ===\nDev was reappointed captain in March 1985 and guided India on a Test series win over England in 1986. This period saw one of his most famous matches, the second Tied Test, in which he was named joint-man of the match with Australian batsman Dean Jones.\nHe was retained as captain for the 1987 Cricket World Cup. In their first match, Australia scored 268 against India. However, after the close of innings, Dev agreed with the umpires that the score should be increased to 270 as one boundary during the innings had been mistakenly signalled as a four and not a six. In their reply, India scored 269 falling short of Australia's score by one run. In the Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, it was reported that \"Kapil Dev's sportsmanship proved the deciding factor in a close-run match\". India went on to reach the semi-final of the 1987 World Cup, where they lost to England. Dev faced the blame for India's defeat as he holed out to deep mid-wicket triggering a collapse that led to the unexpected loss. He did not captain India again, although he was the Vice-captain for India's tour to Pakistan in 1989.\nThe captaincy period was on the whole a difficult one for him as it was mired with reports of differences with Gavaskar, as well as his own inconsistent form as a bowler. However, both men later insisted that these reports were exaggerated. Dev's performance as Captain was better than as a player.\n\n\n=== Skills ===\nDev was a right-arm pace bowler noted for his graceful action and potent outswinger, and was India's main strike bowler for most of his career. He developed a fine inswinging yorker during the 1980s, which he used very effectively against tail-enders. As a batsman, he was a natural striker of the ball who could hook and drive effectively. A naturally aggressive player, he often helped India in difficult situations by taking the attack to the opposition. Nicknamed The Haryana Hurricane, he represented the Haryana cricket team in domestic cricket.\n\n\n=== Bowling style ===\nDev was a fast bowler. However, a fluent run-up and a gather that was perfectly side-on at the time of delivery meant that the outswinger came naturally to him. Usually bowled at a length and direction that always troubled right-handers, his delivery was the bane of most of his victims as he sought to beat the bat on the outside edge, either caught on the off-side cordon or indeed LBW and bowled in case the ball missed the edge. The side-on action meant that, for the first few years, this was the only delivery he could bowl. The deliveries that held their lines or came into the right-hander came through natural variations off the pitch. However, as he gained maturity, the action became less side-on and he developed an inswinger too. He noted in the mid-1980s that the only delivery he could not bowl at will was the leg-cutter.\nBy the end of 1983, Dev already had about 250 Test wickets in just five years and looked well on his way to becoming one of the most prolific wicket-takers ever. However, his bowling declined following knee surgery in 1984, as he lost some of his jump at the crease. Despite this setback, he never missed playing a single test or one-day game on fitness grounds. Though he lost some of his bite, he remained an effective bowler for another ten years and became the second bowler ever to take 400 wickets in Test cricket in 1991\u201392 when he took Mark Taylor's wicket in a series versus Australia in Australia. In that Australian tour he took 25 wickets.\n\n\n=== Final years ===\nDev continued as India's lead pace bowler under a succession of captains in the early 1990s. He was involved in a notable incident during the Lord's Test Match of 1990, when he hit off-spinner Eddie Hemmings for four sixes in succession to take India past the follow-on target. This match featured the highest test score by an Englishman against India, 333 by Graham Gooch. Dev was cited by umpire Dickie Bird as being one of the greatest all-rounders of all-time.He became a valuable batsman in the ODI version of the game, as a pinch-hitter used to accelerate the run-scoring rate, usually in the final ten overs, and was relied upon to stabilise the innings in the event of a collapse. He played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup, his last, under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin and topped the batting strike rate with 125.80 runs per 100 balls. He led the bowling attack with younger talents like Javagal Srinath and Manoj Prabhakar, who would eventually succeed him as India's leading pace bowlers. He retired in 1994, after breaking Richard Hadlee's then standing record for the most Test wickets taken.\n\n\n=== List of centuries by opponent ===\n\n\n== Post retirement ==\n\n\n=== National Player ===\n\nKapil Dev was appointed coach of the Indian national cricket team in 1999, succeeding Anshuman Gaekwad. In his term, India won just one test match (at home against New Zealand) and had two major series losses in Australia (3\u20130) and at home against South Africa (2\u20130) and in general was considered a disappointment. At the height of the match fixing allegation by Manoj Prabhakar \u2013 a charge that was dismissed later, Dev resigned from his position as national coach. Stung by the betting controversy, he announced his farewell stating that \"I bid adieu to the game that gave me so much and then took a great deal of it away on the mere hearsay of a third party\". After a brief interval, he was succeeded as coach by former New Zealand batsman John Wright, who became India's first foreign coach.\n\n\n=== Return ===\nAfter a period of silence away from the public eye, Dev returned to cricket when Wisden announced him as one of the sixteen finalists for the Wisden Indian Cricketer of the Century award in July 2002. Dev pipped longtime teammate Gavaskar and crowd favourite Tendulkar to win the award and claimed the moment as \"my finest hour\".Dev slowly returned to cricket as a bowling consultant and was the bowling coach in the preparatory camp prior to India's tour of Pakistan in March 2004. In October 2006, Dev was nominated as the chairman of National Cricket Academy for a 2-year period.In 2005, he acted in a brief role in the Cult Movie Iqbal written by Vipul K Rawal where he played himself. Initially the director was not keen on approaching him; however, writer Vipul K Rawal put his foot down as the role was written with him in mind.\nIn May 2007, Dev joined the upstart Indian Cricket League (ICL) floated by Zee TV as the chairman of executive board, defending his decision as complimenting BCCI's structure rather than opposing it \u2013 \"We are not looking to create a rival team but helping the Indian board to find more talent\". In June 2007, BCCI responded by revoking the pension for all players who had joined ICL, including Dev. On 21 August 2007, Dev was removed from the chairmanship of the National Cricket Academy, a day after he addressed a formal press conference of the new Indian Cricket League.On 25 July 2012 Dev resigned from ICL and continued to support BCCI, thereby paving way to get back into the BCCI fold.\n\n\n=== Joining Territorial Army ===\nOn 24 September 2008 Dev joined the Indian Territorial Army and was commissioned as a Lieutenant Colonel by General Deepak Kapoor, Chief of the Army Staff. He joined as an honorary officer.\n\n\n=== Chancellor of Haryana's Sports University ===\nHe was appointed as first chancellor of the Sports University of Haryana in 2019. The university is situated in India's Haryana state which he represented in domestic cricket.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe married Romi Bhatia in 1980 and had a daughter, Amiya Dev, on 16 January 1996.In 1993, Dev took up golf. Dev was the only Asian founding member of Laureus Foundation in 2000. Ian Botham and Viv Richards were the other two cricketers on the founding member council of 40. Steve Waugh was added to the Academy members in 2006 when it was expanded from 40 to 42. He pledged his organs during an event organized by Delhi Urological Society on 31 January 2014 at the Airport Authority of India, Officers Club, New Delhi.On 23 October 2020, Dev suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized. He underwent an emergency coronary angioplasty at a hospital in Delhi.\n\n\n== Books ==\nHe has written four books \u2013 three autobiographical and one book on Sikhism. Autobiographical works include \u2014 By God's Decree which came out in 1985, Cricket My Style in 1987, and Straight from the Heart in 2004. His latest book titled We, The Sikhs was released in 2019.\n\n\n== Business interests ==\nDev invested in various business, including:\n\n5% stake in Zicom Electronics (2005)\nCaptain's Eleven (2006) restaurants in Chandigarh and Patna\nKaptain's Retreat Hotel (1983; renovated and reopened in 2002) in Chandigarh\nDev Musco Lighting Pvt Limited in partnership with Musco Lighting to install floodlights in sports venues in India.

        "article": "Vangipurapu Venkata Sai Laxman (pronunciation ; born 1 November 1974) is a former Indian international cricketer and a current cricket commentator and pundit. A right-hand batsman known for his elegant stroke play, Laxman played as a middle-order batsman in Test cricket.\nLaxman is one of the few players to have played 100 Test matches, without ever appearing in a One-Day Cricket World Cup. Despite being a relatively slow runner between the wickets, Laxman compensated with his stroke play and fast scoring. In 2002, he was named one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year.\nIn domestic cricket, Laxman represented Hyderabad. He also played for Lancashire in county cricket. He was also the captain of the Deccan Chargers team in the Indian Premier League during its inaugural season. Later, he played for the Kochi Tuskers IPL team. He is currently a mentor of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. He is popularly called as the 'God of 4th Innings' for his exploits.\nIn 2011, Laxman was awarded the Padma Shri award, India's fourth highest civilian award. In 2012, Laxman retired from international cricket.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLaxman was born in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh (present-day Telangana). Laxman's parents are noted physicians Dr. Shantaram and Dr. Satyabhama of Vijayawada. Laxman is the great grand nephew of India's second President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.Laxman studied at the Little Flower High School, Hyderabad. Though he joined a medical school for his undergraduate studies, Laxman chose cricket as a career.\nHe married G. R. Shailaja from Guntur, Computer Applications graduate, on 16 February 2004. They have two children \u2013 a son, Sarvajit and a daughter, Achinthya.\n\n\n== Playing style and position ==\nLaxman is known for his fluid style, technically sound and aggressiveness. Sambil Bal of ESPN Crincinfo writes: \"At his sublime best, VVS Laxman is a sight for the gods. Wristy, willowy and sinuous, he can match \u2013 sometimes even better \u2013 Tendulkar for strokeplay... [He] has the rare gift of being able to hit the same ball to either side.\" He was equally skilled against both pace and spin, with great timing and outstanding ability to place the ball splitting the tightest field positions. Laxman was particularly skillful in using his wrists (reminiscent of his role model and fellow Hyderabadi, Mohammed Azharuddin) that allowed him to place the same ball to different areas of the field.\nStanding tall and still at the crease, Laxman had a keen awareness of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. He plays with a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At the start of his career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best players of the hard (new) ball. However, Indian selectors played around with his batting positions, whenever India felt a lacuna regarding any batting number. He was forced to play in almost every position, including opening. Laxman found his home in the middle order, where he played most of his best innings, batting at numbers 3, 5 and 6. In a 2001 test against Australia and promoted to no. 3 in the second innings from his first innings position of 6, he scored 281 to take India to a huge lead after following on. Though Laxman was ideally suited for No. 3, Rahul Dravid was always preferred over him to bat at one-down, while Sachin Tendulkar was established at No. 4. As a result, Laxman played around 63 percent of his Test innings at No. 5 or 6. This meant that Laxman often found himself batting with tail-end batsmen, and is reflected in his final statistics, which show that he has a relatively high proportion of not out innings (34 of 225, or 15 per cent \u2014 for comparison, Tendulkar finished not out in around 10 per cent of his Test innings, and Dravid in 11 per cent). Nevertheless, Laxman batted particularly well with non-specialist lower-order batsmen, and was able, with their support, to save and win numerous matches for India (for example, the Mohali 2010 Test against Australia).\n\n\n== Youth career ==\nLaxman made his Under-19 debut for India against Australia in February 1994. Batting at six, he made 88 in his debut innings against a bowling attack that consisted of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, both of whom were making their debuts too. In the second game of the series, Laxman scored an unbeaten 151 in the first innings and 77 in the second innings to help his team register a 226-run victory. He continued his good form as he scored 36 and 84 in the third game to end up as the leading run-scorer of the series. The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series, where he managed scores of 24, 22 and 77. Later in August that year, the India Under-19 team toured England for 2 ODIs and 3 Test matches. Laxman disappointed in the ODIs with scores of 20 and 5. However, in the first Test he struck 119 in the first innings, but did not get to bat in the second innings as India cruised to a 9-wicket win. He made only 28 in the second match and 4 in the third.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nLaxman made his first-class debut for Hyderabad against Punjab in the quarter-final match of 1992\u201393 Ranji Trophy season. He scored a duck in the first innings and 17 in the second. He played only one match for Hyderabad in the next season, before getting dropped. However, he was named in the South Zone squad for the 1994-95 Duleep Trophy in the back of his impressive outings for India Under-19s, but he failed to score big in the tournament. In the following Ranji Trophy season, Laxman notched up 532 runs from five matches at an average of 76 scoring two centuries. In the semi-final of the Duleep Trophy of 1995\u201396 season against West Zone, Laxman scored 47 in the first innings and a spectacular 121 in the second innings, sharing a 199-run partnership with skipper Rahul Dravid. He had another brilliant Ranji season the next year, as he piled 775 runs in just 11 innings at an average of 86 with 3 centuries and a best of 203* that came against Karnataka in the semi-final, which Hyderabad eventually lost. He was picked to play for Rest of India against Karnataka in the Irani Cup and also in the Board President's XI squad against the touring Australian team. He played only three matches in 1996-97 Ranji season, where he scored three half-centuries, before getting picked for the Indian Test team against South Africa.After the tests he joined Lancashire as their overseas player in place of Brad Hodge. He played in five games of the county championship and showed glimpses of his sublime batting. In their final County Championship game of 2007, against Surrey at the Oval, Laxman scored a century in the second innings in which Lancashire were chasing 489 to win. They just missed out by 25 runs and subsequently lost the Championship to Sussex. His performance for Lancashire was good with 380 runs scored in 5 matches at an average of 54.28 with 2 centuries and 2 half-centuriesLaxman was supposed to replace Adam Voges for Nottinghamshire, but this move was vetoed by the BCCI due to the fact that there were players from the rival Indian Cricket League playing for Nottinghamshire.\n\n\n=== Indian Premier League ===\nLaxman was originally named as the Icon Player for his home franchise Deccan Chargers before the first season of the IPL. But he gave up the Icon Player status in a bid to allow his team spend a bigger purse at the auction. The Deccan Chargers bought him at the auction for $375,000 and named him the captain for the first season. However, Laxman dropped himself from the team halfway through the season, after the team had a horrendous run in the tournament. Adam Gilchrist took over as captain and led the side in the next two seasons as well; Laxman did score 155 runs from the 6 games that he played at an average of 31 and strike rate of 118. He batted at 3 in the first few games before opening the innings with Gilchrist in some matches where he found more success. His only half-century of the tournament (52 off 44) came against Royal Challengers Bangalore. He did score a couple more fluent innings that season including an unbeaten 37 from 26 balls against Mumbai Indians and 48 from 34 balls against Kings XI Punjab. However, he struggled with the bat in the next two seasons and sat out the tournament after playing only 5\u20136 matches.\nAt the mega-auction in 2011, Laxman was bought by the newly formed franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for $400,000. This time, though, he was injured after the first three games and missed the rest of the season. In the first match against Royal Challengers, he opened the innings with Brendon McCullum and scored an attractive 36 from 29 deliveries. But, the Kochi franchise was terminated later that year and all the players of the team were put in the auction in 2012. However, Laxman, who had a base price of $400,000, found no buyers and he couldn't participate in the 2012 edition of the tournament. Then in IPL 2013, he was appointed as a mentor for Sunrisers Hyderabad Team.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early years (1996\u20132000) ===\nLaxman made his Test debut in 1996 against South Africa at Ahmedabad, scoring a fifty in the second innings of the match. In the second game at Kolkata, he scored 14 and 1. He played just one Test in the South African tour the following month and was unable to cement his place in a star-studded Indian middle order. Instead, he was asked to open the innings, starting in West Indies in 1997. At Kingston, he scored 64 in his first innings as opener. However, he averaged only 28 in that series playing as an opener. But intermittently continued in this role for nearly three years, but without any consistent success. In 1998 at Calcutta, he scored 95 against Australia opening the innings with Navjot Sidhu who scored 97. India went on to win the match by an innings and 219 runs. Though he was selected in the Test squad that toured New Zealand in 1998, he did not get to play a single game as Ajay Jadeja was preferred over Laxman to open the innings with Sidhu. Laxman scored a duck on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Pepsi Tri-Series in 1998. He had a horrible run in the ODIs in 1998 which resulted in him getting dropped from the ODI team for more than a year. Against Pakistan in 1999, he scored just 66 runs from two Tests, averaging a modest 16. In the first match of the Asian Test Championship later that year, Laxman scored 67 against Pakistan, but failed to score consistently, before getting dropped from the Test team as well.Laxman returned to playing first-class cricket in 1999 to regain his place in the national team. In the 1999\u20132000 season of Ranji Trophy, he broke the record for most runs in a Ranji season when he made 1415 runs, at an average of 108, in just 9 matches notching up eight hundreds \u2013 a record that still remains intact. His performance was rewarded when, in January 2000, he was recalled in the Indian squad for the Australian tour. He scored 167 in the third and final Test match at Sydney when the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with Glenn McGrath's destructive bowling, a rare high point for India in an otherwise disastrous tour. Despite this success against an attack containing both McGrath and Shane Warne, Laxman apparently decided that he would return to domestic cricket, rather than continue playing as opener, a role which he believed did not suit him. As a result, Laxman was out of the Test team for nearly a year. He was recalled in late 2000, and also found a spot in the side for the home series against Australia in 2001.\n\n\n=== Golden series (2001 against Australia) ===\nLaxman's career changed dramatically in the 2001 home series against Australia. In the first Test at Mumbai, Laxman made 20 and 12, as the entire Indian batting line-up, with the exception of Sachin Tendulkar, capitulated, leading to a 10-wicket defeat. This was Australia's 16th consecutive Test win and extended their own world record.In the next Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, however, Laxman produced a match-winning and series-defining performance. After scoring 59 in the first innings, Laxman shot to fame with an extraordinary knock of 281 in the second innings (following on) when under tremendous pressure and with Australia looking set for a crushing 17th win in a row. He broke Sunil Gavaskar's long standing Indian Test record score of 236*. This remained the highest ever by an Indian until it was eclipsed by Virender Sehwag's triple ton against Pakistan in Multan in March 2004. The innings also contributed to a record partnership of 376 with Rahul Dravid who made 180 and together they survived the whole 4th day. Laxman's performance was of enormous consequence: India had been on the brink of an innings defeat but went on to win the Test and the series, denying Steve Waugh's conquest of the \"final frontier\". This was only the third time in the history of cricket that a team had managed to win a Test after being forced to follow on. It has become one of the most celebrated tales of Indian cricket, and the innings is ranked the sixth best Test innings ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. At the time, the pitch was taking significant turn, and to negate Laxman's free scoring, Australian leg spinner Shane Warne pitched his deliveries into the footmarks outside leg stump. However, such was Laxman's play that he consistently drove the ball through long on for boundaries against the spin, something that is considered to be technically dangerous. When Warne attempted to stop Laxman from scoring by defensively stationing most of the fielders on the leg side (leg theory) and bowling outside leg stump, Laxman proceeded to skip down the pitch and drive Warne inside-out through the vacant off side, hitting through the line of a substantially turning ball. Warne later admitted that he was clueless as to how to stop Laxman.\nLaxman went on to score 65 and 66 in the third and the final Test match at Chennai, which India won by 2 wickets and won the series 2\u20131. Laxman had great amount of success batting at No.3 in the ODI series that followed the Tests, as he scored 45, 51, 83, 11 and 101 in the five games, thus cementing his spot in the ODI line-up as well. In the Coca-Cola Tri-Series later that year in Sri Lanka, Laxman scored 212 runs in 7 matches with two fifties and a decent average of 36.\n\n\n=== Permanent member (2002\u20132004) ===\nLaxman then cemented his place both in the Test and one day teams for a few years. After bad performances in the Test series against Zimbabwe, he did well in the first two ODIs scoring 75 and 52, but couldn't convert the starts into big knocks in the next three matches. Laxman managed to score a fighting 89 in the second Test at Port Elizabeth, when the rest of the team struggled to survive against Shaun Pollock's deadly bowling, helping his team put up 201 on the board and avoid an embarrassing follow-on. Against the touring England in late 2001, he scored 75, sharing a 100-plus run partnership with Tendulkar to take his team out of trouble. He had a great tour of West Indies, as he scored 474 runs in 8 innings at an average of 79. He had scores of 69, 69*, 74, 1, 43, 130, 65* and 23 in that series. He performed reasonably well during West Indies tour of India as well, particularly in the third match at Kolkata, where he scored 48 and 154*. He followed it up with brilliant showing in the 7-match ODI series as well with scores of 47, 99, 66 and 71 in the first five games. But his form dropped during India's tour of New Zealand in 2002\u201303. In the first Test at Wellington, he got a pair and in the second match he could score only 23 and 4. However, he had a brilliant 2-match Test series against the same team in India as he scored a half-century along with 44 in the first Test and 104* and 67* in the second match. He won the Man of the Series award for his impressive batting performances in the two Test match series. In October 2003, he scored 102 in the first ODI against Australia at Gwalior, sharing a 190-run second wicket partnership with Tendulkar. However he failed to deliver on a consistent basis in ODIs. He continued to perform well against Australia, especially during India's tour of Australia in 2003\u201304, in which he hit three ODI and two Test centuries. He was involved in two century partnerships, one with Tendulkar and the other with Dravid, in the Brisbane ODI against Australia where he remained unbeaten on 102. His 106* against the same opponents at Sydney saw him put up a fourth-wicket partnership of 213 runs with Yuvraj Singh, who scored his career-best 139. In the next ODI against Zimbabwe, Laxman scored a 138-ball 131, once again setting up 2 hundred-run stands. He scored 148 in the famous Adelaide Test, sharing a triple century partnership with Rahul Dravid, which India won by 4 wickets. This was their first Test victory in Australia in two decades. His innings of 178 at Sydney also came in a triple century partnership, on this occasion with Sachin Tendulkar. India went on to post 705/7 in their first innings which is their highest total in Test cricket. Laxman scored a total of 494 runs from the 4 Tests at a staggering average of 82. During this series, Ian Chappell described Laxman as Very Very Special Laxman. His 107 (104) against Pakistan in the fifth and the final ODI at Lahore, helped India win by 40 runs and clinch the series 3\u20132.\n\n\n=== Decline of form (2004\u20132005) ===\nHowever, Laxman's form was on the decline since the series against Australia. Beginning with the series in Pakistan in 2004, Laxman had only Test centuries to his credit, with one coming against a weak Zimbabwe side. He averaged just 31 in the Test series in Pakistan in 3 matches. His only half-century (71) came in a high-scoring game at Rawalpindi where India made a mammoth 600 to win the game by an innings and 131 runs. He struggled to score in the ODI series in England which put question marks over his future in the shorter format. He struggled against his favourite opponents Australia in the home series in October\u2013November 2004, although his 69 in the low-scoring final Test at Mumbai was instrumental for India to record a consolation victory. He had a mixed Test series against Pakistan in 2005. He scored 58 in the first Test, 0 and 24 in the second and 79* and 5 in the third. He batted well in the Sri Lanka Test series scoring a fifty at Delhi and a crucial century (104) in the last match at Ahmedabad. Laxman was dropped after scoring a duck in the first Test against England at Nagpur in March 2006. He regained his place for the tour of the West Indies in place of the injured Tendulkar, and made a hundred in the third Test. He also scored a resilient 63 in the second innings to deny West Indies the victory in the same match. In ODIs, Laxman was left out persistently since Greg Chappell took over as coach in mid-2005, mainly on account of his slow ground fielding and running between the wickets; Laxman is a highly regarded close-catching fielder in stationary positions but in ODIs, these positions are generally disused except for the opening phases of the match, and players otherwise have to patrol substantial spaces and retrieve balls. Another reason was a perception that his batting is too one paced for ODI cricket and that he lacks the ability to score at a high rate as required when the batting team has the momentum, or in the closing stages of the innings. This was despite his superb form in Australia and Pakistan in early 2004, when he made four centuries in 14 games, including three in a week in the VB Series in Australia.\n\n\n=== Return to form ===\n\nIn December 2005, Laxman helped India to victory against Sri Lanka with a fine century. In June 2006, Laxman again rescued India from a difficult position against the West Indies with a gritty century. In November 2006, he was selected in the test squad for India's tour of South Africa. In the first test in Johannesburg Laxman scored 73 in the second innings to help India claim a historic 123 run win. In the 2007 tour of England Laxman produced three good innings, two of which were half-centuries and a vital 39 that helped India draw the first test at Lords. He passed the 5000 run landmark in the first day of the final test.\nIn India's home series against Pakistan in 2007, V.V.S. Laxman once again showed his importance to the team with a disciplined batting performance in the 1st Test at Delhi, as he scored 72* in dire circumstances. He then followed that innings of 72 in the first test with 112 in the second test. This ensured his place on the tour of Australia which would be his third to that country.\n\n\n=== Late career ===\nLaxman's good form continued in the 2007-08 Test series against Australia with him scoring 109 against Australia on the second day of the controversial Sydney Test to put India back into the contest. It was his 12th hundred in Test matches, and his 5th against Australia. It was also his third consecutive century at SCG, giving him an average well above 90 at the venue. He followed this up with a gritty knock of 79 in Perth, assisted by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and RP Singh, which set India up to record a historic and unexpected victory at a ground on which previously no Asian team had won. He hit 51 in the first innings of the final Test at Adelaide. He finished as the second highest run-getter for India in that series, only behind Sachin Tendulkar.\nHe, like all other Indian batsmen, struggled in Sri Lanka against the spin duo of Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis later in July\u2013August that year. India lost the first Test by an innings and 239 runs at Colombo, where Laxman's first innings score of 50 was the only half-century scored by an Indian batsman in either innings. Laxman scored another fifty in that series, in the third Test, an unbeaten 61 as India went on to lose the game by 8 wickets and the series 2\u20131. Laxman was dismissed by Mendis on all five occasions in that series. He also crossed the 6000-run milestone during the series.\nAgainst Australia, in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy later that year, Laxman was in top form as he scored 381 runs from 4 Tests with a double-hundred and two fifties. During the third Test at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi, Laxman scored an unbeaten 200 in the first innings with characteristic use of his wrists and flicks through the leg side. In the same innings, Gautam Gambhir scored 206, Laxman and Gambhir becoming the first pair of batsmen to score double-centuries in the same innings for India, and the first to do so against Australia. This was his second double-century in Test cricket with the previous one coming against the same opponents. He made an unbeaten 59 in the second innings and was named Man of the Match. The match was also the last game of India's spin wizard Anil Kumble who was also the captain of the team. In the final Test at Nagpur, Laxman scored another half-century in the first innings of the match.\n\nIn 2009, Laxman continued to be in brilliant form. He had scored 76 and 124* in the 2nd Test at Napier in New Zealand. The century helped India salvage a draw and avoid an innings defeat. In the next match at Wellington he hit a well-composed 61 in the second innings. Against Sri Lanka later that year in a home series, Laxman hit three fifties in four innings as India went on to win the series comfortably. His unbeaten 51 in the second innings combining with a hundred from Tendulkar helped India draw the first Test at Ahmedabad. Laxman scored two fifties in the next two games as India went on to win both matches by an innings.\nHe injured himself during the first match of the two-match Test series in Bangladesh in January 2010 after scoring another unbeaten half-century. The injury forced him to sit out for three weeks and he returned to action only during the final Test against South Africa held in Kolkata. He scored 143* in a record stand for the seventh wicket with MS Dhoni. The test was eventually won by India by an innings and 57 runs in the last 10 minutes of the fifth day's play, despite centuries in both innings from South African batsman Hashim Amla. This victory also helped India draw the Test series and remain the world Number 1 team. He also passed 7000 Test runs during the innings.\nLaxman helped India to level the series with Sri Lanka in August 2010 when he hit 103 not out in the run-chase, resulting in a five-wicket win in the Third Test, after scoring 69 in the first innings. He was awarded the Man of the Match for this brilliant effort. He scored a total of 279 runs in that series at an average of 70.In October, he once again turned around another match that appeared headed for a comfortable Australian victory, in the first Test in Mohali. Laxman was suffering with a back problem and needed Suresh Raina as his runner, and the Indians had collapsed to 124/8 in pursuit of 216. He and paceman Ishant Sharma put on 81 to take the score to 205 before Sharma fell. Last man Pragyan Ojha then managed to survive till the end as the hosts completed a thrilling one-wicket win. Laxman ended on 73 not out. He was ruled out of the remaining matches of the series due to his injury. In November, he helped India recover from 15/5 in the second innings of the first Test against New Zealand at Ahmedabad and the match was drawn. In the second match of the series at his home ground Hyderabad, he scored 74 and the match ended in another draw.\nAfter failing in the first Test of the South African tour, Laxman once again helped India to a historic win at Durban. India struggled to cope with Dale Steyn in the first innings before getting bundled out for 205. Laxman's 38 was the highest score in that innings. In the second innings, India were struggling at 94/5 and he put on crucial partnerships with Dhoni and Zaheer Khan to help his team to 228, giving South Africa a target of 303. South Africa were bundled out for 215 giving India an 87-run win that helped level the series 1\u20131. He was awarded the Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 96.\nIn three test matches, Laxman scored three consecutive fifties including two scores in eighties against the West Indies during India's tour of West Indies in June 2011.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nDuring India's Tour to England, Laxman scored just two half-centuries in eight innings as India went down 0\u20134 to England. This was India's first Test series loss since its 2007-08 tour of Australia. Laxman got out with the pull shot frequently in this series, which otherwise he is good at.\nAs part of West Indies tour to India in September 2011, Laxman scored a magnificent 176 not out in the second test, and India went to win the match by an innings and 13 runs. Laxman was adjudged Man of the Match. India went on to win the series 1\u20130.\nLaxman failed to live to his expectations during India's tour of Australia in November 2011, as India went down 0\u20134 to Australia, with Laxman scoring only two half centuries in eight innings. For the first time in four tours to Australia, Laxman failed to register a century in the series; and also for the first time in four test matches played at Sydney Cricket Ground he failed to touch the three figure mark.\nAfter this series, there were calls from the media and former cricketers that it was time for older players like Laxman, Dravid and Sachin to consider retirement.\nOn 18 August 2012, Laxman announced his retirement from international cricket. Although he was selected for the upcoming New Zealand series, he opted not to play in the series but he will play in domestic cricket for Hyderabad and the Indian Premier League . It was announced that the northern stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium will now be named after him.\n\n\n=== Record against Australia ===\nLaxman was particularly prolific against Australia, in both Tests and One Day Internationals. Six out of his 17 Test hundreds, and four out of his six ODI hundreds came against Australia. He has two double-centuries in Tests, both against Australia: his personal best of 281 at Kolkata in 2000\u201301, and 200 not out at Feroz Shah Kotla in 2008\u201309. The Australians admitted that they did not know where to bowl to him.\n\n\n== The Cricket Advisory Committee ==\nLaxman is one of the member of the elite three-man panel that consists of three Legends of Cricket, Laxman being one, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly being the other two. This three-man panel is known as the Cricket Advisory Committee of BCCI. The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) was set up by Mr. Anurag Thakur (then Secretary) and late BCCI President Mr. Jagmohan Dalmiya. This committee was set up to advise BCCI on various issues and to help BCCI with their immense Cricketing experience. The Cricket Advisory Committee took several important decisions that includes the recommendation for the selection of Anil Kumble (ex-coach) who stepped down as the coach and recommendation of selection of Ravi Shastri (present coach) for the post of coach of the Indian cricket team.\nLaxman was also appointed as the batting consultant in Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB)'s vision 2020 project.\n\n\n== International centuries ==\n\nLaxman made his Test debut against South Africa in November 1996, and took almost four years to score his first century when he scored 167 against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2000. Laxman's next century came against the same team in 2001, when he made 281 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The score is the highest individual score in a Test match between India and Australia. It was also the highest individual score by an Indian at that time. In Test matches, Laxman has scored centuries against all the Test cricket playing nations except England and Bangladesh. As of 2012, he is seventh on the list of leading Test century makers for India. Laxman has scored two double centuries and has been dismissed four times between the score of 90 and 99 in test matches.In ODIs, Laxman has scored six centuries against three countries including four against Australia. His first ODI century was against Australia in the last match of a five match series, held at the Fatorda Stadium in Margao in 2001. His highest score of 131 came against Zimbabwe at the Adelaide Oval in 2004. Two out of his six ODI centuries were scored at home grounds and four were at away (opposition's home) or neutral venues. He has been dismissed once between the score of 90 and 99.\n\n\n=== Key ===\n\n\n=== Test cricket centuries ===\n\n\n=== ODI centuries ===\n\n\n== Achievements and awards ==\nPadma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, 2011.\nArjuna Award, by the Government of India in recognition of his outstanding achievement in sports, 2001.\nWisden Cricketer of the Year: 2002.\nHe is one of the few cricketers to score the most centuries (3) in a single ODI series.\nHis innings of 281 against Australia at Kolkata in 2001 was ranked sixth in Wisden's list of 100 great Test innings in the history of the game.\nHe has the record of taking the most catches (12) by a non-wicketkeeper in a single ODI series. He shares this record with Allan Border.\nHe along with Rahul Dravid share the world record for the highest partnership (376 Runs) in 3rd innings of a test match for any wicket during a winning cause.\nLaxman is one of the six Indian test players in history to score 100 runs in a single session of a test match.\nLaxman is the second Indian player to score 1000 or more runs at a single ground. He scored 1217 runs at an average of 110.63 at Eden gardens.\nOnly Indian to score 1000 runs at a single ground with an average more than 100.\nOne of only 3 international players (and the only Indian player) to make an unbeaten fifty in both innings of a Test on more than one occasion (the others being Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Steve Smith).\nLaxman was awarded an honorary doctorate degree on 4 February 2015 by Teri University, New Delhi.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVVS Laxman at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Philip Clive Roderick Tufnell (born 29 April 1966) is a former English international cricketer turned television personality. A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he played in 42 Test matches and 20 One Day Internationals for the England cricket team, as well as playing for Middlesex County Cricket Club from 1986 to 2002. Tufnell took 121 Test match wickets and, although his Test average of 37.68 is considered high for a genuine bowler, he took over 1,000 wickets across all first-class cricket at an average of 29.35, and his personality, trademark behaviour and \"great control of flight\" when playing made him a popular sports personality.Following his retirement in 2002, Tufnell has built on his popularity with several television appearances, including They Think It's All Over, Celebrity Deal Or No Deal, A Question of Sport, Strictly Come Dancing., and winning I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nTufnell was educated at Highgate School where his cricketing prowess was recognised and he was appointed captain of the Junior School's First XI despite the fact he was not yet in the top year. On leaving Highgate, he attended and played cricket for Southgate School.  He then trained in quantity surveying and was faced with the tough decision of whether to play cricket professionally or to work as a quantity surveyor. He chose to do the former.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\n\nAs a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, Tufnell played 42 Test matches and 20 One Day Internationals for England between 1990 and 2001, and 316 first-class matches, mainly for Middlesex. \nTufnell was occasionally inspired with the ball, taking 11\u201393 against Australia at the Oval in 1997 (for which he won the Man of the Match award after England won by 19 runs) and seven wickets in the match (6-25 in the first innings) against the West Indies at the Oval in 1991, but he took his 121 Test wickets with a bowling average of 37.68 across his whole Test career. Mark Waugh theorised that \"if you attack him, he can go on the defensive, and it puts him off his game\",  although Waugh was Tufnell's most frequent test victim, being dismissed a total of seven times by him, three of them bowled.According to Michael Parkinson, a British talk show host, \"at the age of nine he was opening the bowling and the batting for his club's junior team\". Parkinson also believes that his \"ordinary fielding made him a luxury in the view of the ... (English cricket) management (circa August 1996)\". However, Tufnell's fielding did improve during his career. He was nicknamed \"The Cat\" due to his propensity to be found sleeping in the dressing room. He also acquired the nickname \"Two Sugars\" due to his well-known love of tea. According to England teammate Mike Atherton, Tufnell smoked more than occasionally.During his career spanning sixteen years with Middlesex, Tufnell took  1,057 first-class wickets in the English game at an average of 29.35. His autobiography What Now ? ISBN 0-00-218816-3  was published in 1999.\nTufnell also received an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University on 20 July 2011 in recognition of his achievements in sport and the media.\n\n\n== Broadcasting career ==\n\n\n=== Radio ===\nSince 2003, Tufnell has appeared as a summariser on BBC Radio's Test Match Special. He has also hosted The Phil Tufnell Cricket Show and Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show on BBC Radio 5.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nTufnell retired from professional cricket before the 2003 season in order to participate in the second series of the reality television show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! which he won. Prior to this, he had appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank. He was a team captain on sports quiz show They Think It's All Over until 2005. In 2004, he made two guest appearances on British soap opera Family Affairs and co-presented the ITV game show Simply the Best with Kirsty Gallacher.\nTufnell was a team captain on the BBC One panel show A Question of Sport. He also makes regular appearances as a reporter on the BBC One magazine show The One Show.On 12 April 2008, Tufnell and his wife Dawn appeared on the ITV game show All Star Mr & Mrs.On 4 October and 1 November 2008, Tufnell appeared on the game show Hole in the Wall. In 2009, Tufnell competed in the seventh series of the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, partnering professional dancer Katya Virshilas. The couple were eliminated in the ninth week.On 7 October 2011, he appeared on the BBC One panel show Would I Lie To You?, where he claimed to have recurring dreams in which he is a potato, being chased by a pitchfork.\nOn 19 November 2011, Tufnell appeared on a celebrity edition of ITV quiz show The Chase.\nIn 2012, he co-presented The Flowerpot Gang with Anneka Rice and Joe Swift.\nDuring the week of 12 to 16 May 2014, Tufnell appeared on the daytime Channel 4 game show Draw It!On 1 February 2015, Tufnell competed in Get Your Act Together on ITV and The Jump on Channel 4.In December 2018, Tufnell joined Australia's Seven Network as a guest commentator for their coverage of the BBL and Sri Lankan Test matches.\n\n\n== Books ==\nTufnell co-authored a humorous book, Phil Tufnell's' A To Z of Cricket with cricket journalist Adam Hathaway.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe has been married three times, to Alison Squires (divorced 1989), Lisa Bar (divorced), and Dawn. \nTufnell's first marriage to Alison Squires ended in 1989. He has two daughters: one with ex-girlfriend Jane McElvoy, and one with ex-wife Lisa Bar. Tufnell's personal life hit the headlines in 1994 when he was fined \u00a3800 after admitting assaulting his former girlfriend McElvoy, after she ended their relationship.In 1997, while on a tour of New Zealand, reports emerged that he left a toilet cubicle trailing the scent of cannabis but this time he was exonerated. During divorce proceedings, Bar produced court documents accusing Tufnell of causing her to endure 'anxiety, stress and an eating disorder'. She also claimed he had continually harassed her and abused her. He is now married to Dawn and has a step daughter.Tufnell is the president of a cricket charity \u2013 Cricket for Change. He is also an Ambassador of UK children's charity The Children's Trust for children with brain injury and neurodisability.

In September 2010, police told Kaneria that the investigation had been closed and that he had been cleared of any allegations.He was selected for the two-match Test series against South Africa.

He then played in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for HBL, taking 18 wickets in two games.On 17 February 2012, during Mervyn Westfield's trial on spot fixing charges, Kaneria was named in court as the man who approached Westfield with the idea. They were teammates at the time the alleged approach took place.\nNow in June 2012, both have been found guilty of offences by an ECB disciplinary panel. As a consequence, Kaneria has been banned for life from playing cricket in England and Wales by the aforementioned panel. The PCB had previously agreed to abide by the ECB's decision.\nKaneria appealed against the lifetime ban on him by the ECB for his involvement in a spot-fixing scandal. The appeal against English Cricket Board's decision was denied in July 2013 for the second time, with the ECB saying \"We note, with regret, that Mr Kaneria has neither made any admission of guilt nor expressed any remorse for his corrupt actions, despite the weight of evidence against him.\"In October 2018, after years of denying his guilt, Kaneria admitted to his involvement in the 2009 spot-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKaneria is a Hindu and an ethnic Gujarati. He is married to Dharmita Kaneria (a daughter of a Varasia family) and has a son Nadish Kaneria and daughter Parisa Kaneria.\nHe is the cousin of former Pakistani wicket-keeper Anil Dalpat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of international cricket five-wicket hauls by Danish Kaneria\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDanish Kaneria at ESPNcricinfo\nDanish Kaneria Interview"

        "article": "Krishnamachari Srikkanth pronunciation  (born 21 December 1959) also known as Kris Srikkanth is a former captain of the Indian cricket team and former chairman of the selection committee. He played a crucial part in India's win in 1983 Cricket World Cup by contributing crucial 38 runs as a top scorer. He represented Tamil Nadu in the Indian domestic circuit. He is also a commentator on Star Sports Tamil.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSrikkanth played domestic cricket, for Tamil Nadu and South Zone. He made his One Day International debut against England in Ahmedabad in 1981, followed two days later by his Test debut against England at Bombay at the age of 21. He opened the innings partnering Sunil Gavaskar. Known for his aggressive batting style, he was an early role model for opening batsmen in future years to adopt a similar approach.\nAs he matured, he tempered his aggression somewhat and became a mainstay of the Indian cricket team. He was an integral member of the Indian squad when they won the 1983 Prudential World Cup and 1985 Benson & Hedges World Championship of Cricket. In the 1983 World Cup final against the West Indies, Srikkanth top-scored in the finals.He was made the captain of the Indian team in 1989, incidentally under his captaincy Sachin Tendulkar made his debut. He remained the captain of the team for India's tour of Pakistan in 1990 and managed to draw all the Tests of the series. But the selectors were disappointed with his batting failures and dropped him. He returned two years later and played for another year before being dropped again. He retired from international cricket in 1993. He was the first Indian player to score a half-century and pick up 5 wickets in an ODI. He achieved this feat against New Zealand at Visakhapatnam in 1988.\nSrikkanth holds the unusual distinction of scoring the only run ever scored in international cricket at Ray Mitchell Oval, in Mackay, Australia. The venue hosted its only international match during the 1992 Cricket World Cup, and the match was washed out after two deliveries.In June 2013, Srikkanth participated in the 6th season of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa.\n\n\n== Style ==\nSrikkanth was an opening batsman noted for his aggressive attacking strokes in contrast to his first batting partner and senior Sunil Gavaskar. He is the pioneer in Pinch-hitting in ODIs at least a decade before Mark Greatbatch started in the 1992 World-Cup & Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya much later. He was known to take risks even in the early part of the innings, often scoring boundaries over the inner ring of fielders. He shares three 100-run ODI partnerships with Ravi Shastri which included the first for India in ODI.\n\n\n== Post retirement ==\nAfter retirement he had a stint as the coach of the India 'A' team. He has since been a broadcaster and commentator with various sports and news channels. On 18 February 2008, Krish Srikkanth was named the ambassador for the Chennai Super Kings franchise of Indian Premier League.On 27 September 2008, he was appointed the Chief Selector of the Indian Cricket team. His tenure ended in 2012.\nOn 20 December 2012, Krish Srikkanth was named the ambassador for the Sunrisers Hyderabad franchise of Indian Premier League.Also, he is a commentator for the TV Network Star Sports Tamil. Srikkanth is also included to the panel of All India Council of Sports (AICS) as a member in January 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSrikkanth is an electrical engineer who graduated from College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai. Srikkanth is married to Vidya. Srikkanth has two sons, one of whom, Anirudha, plays for Tamil Nadu cricket team and has played for both Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League. Their eldest son is Aditya.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nJiiva will play Kris Srikanth in the upcoming film 83.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKrishnamachari Srikkanth at ESPNcricinfo\nKrishnamachari Srikkanth on Twitter"

        "article": "Bernard Lance Cairns (born 10 October 1949) is a former all-rounder who played for the New Zealand cricket team, and is the father of New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns.\nHe was also known for the unusual bat he played with throughout much of his career. Known as \"Excalibur\", the shoulders of the bat were planed down to form a conical rather than rectangular shape.Cairns was a swing bowler with an unorthodox 'front on' action. He took 130 Test Match wickets and 89 ODI wickets. He took ten wickets in New Zealand's first ever win on English soil, at Headingley in 1983.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nIn a domestic match, for Otago v Wellington, he hit 110, his only first-class century, in 51 balls hitting 9 sixes in an hour. He scored 928 Test Match and 987 ODI runs at more than a run a ball.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe was a member of both the one-day and Test New Zealand teams between 1974 and 1985. He also appeared for Central Districts, Northern Districts and Otago in New Zealand domestic cricket. He was also the professional for Bishop Auckland in the North \nYorkshire and South Durham League in the North East of England.\n\n\n=== Record hitting ===\nNew Zealand were favourites coming into the finals of the World Series Cup, a tournament heavily hyped as a chance for New Zealand to gain 'revenge' after the 'underarm' incident in 1980/81. The 1982/83 series saw New Zealand achieve an impressive run of victories in the ten match qualifying round with Australia and England. This included three consecutive wins over Australia and a famous match in Adelaide, where two world records were broken on the same day. New Zealand scored a world record 297\u20136, in beating England's 296\u20135.\nCairns set the scene for a dramatic run chase with 49 off 24 balls, which included three sixes off the English spinners. However, it took a match-winning seventh-wicket partnership of 121 by Jeremy Coney (47 not out) and 'Man of the Match' Richard Hadlee (79), to bring New Zealand home for an 'impossible' victory, watched by nearly 1.5 million Kiwis on television, almost half the population and a record for a sporting telecast at the time.\nAfter a rain-affected First Final in Sydney, New Zealand went to the MCG one-nil down in the best of three finals series. Without the injured Hadlee (who missed both Finals), New Zealand had collapsed, beaten and demoralised, at 44\u20136, chasing Australia's score of 302\u20138. Dennis Lillee, who had just waved off New Zealand's last recognised batsman, awaited the arrival of Cairns.\nLillee's first ball was a bouncer that hit Cairns on the head. The batsman's response was to hit two sixes in three balls off Ken MacLeay, before hitting two consecutive sixes off Rodney Hogg, and in the next over, doing the same to Lillee. The highlight was undoubtedly a one-handed shot off Lillee, which soared over the fine leg fence. Cairns' dismissal was an anti-climax; out for 52, offering a simple catch to Steve Smith at cover off the bowling of Geoff Lawson.\n\"He backs off again and thrashes that one! And that's cleared Graeme Wood's head at mid-off! That's the sixth one! That must be an incredible bat he's got! It must be made of extremely good English willow.\"\n\n\"Very heavy English willow ! And there goes Excalibur into action again! Straight over the top of long-off, one of the most difficult shots in the book and umpire Tony Crafter's arms are growing heavy, he's been putting them above his head so often he's getting tired!\" - TCN Nine commentators Ian Chappell and Frank Tyson, 13 February 1983.\nNew Zealand eventually lost the match by 149 runs, and the Finals series 2\u20130, to an Australian team that had been markedly inferior in the preceding qualifying stages of the competition.\nDespite Cairns' heroics (he also hit a spectacular six over cover off Lawson in the First Final at the SCG) Richard Hadlee's absence from both finals was probably the reason for New Zealand's 'shattered dream'.\nNevertheless, the New Zealand team, and Cairns in particular, received unprecedented adulation when they returned home for a three-match series against England, who had lost the Ashes 2-1 and had failed to make the WSC Finals in their recently completed Australian tour. England were desperate to salvage something from their tour down under and 'The Rothmans Cup' was the last prize on offer.\nNew Zealand whitewashed the hapless 'Poms', winning with three memorable performances to sold-out crowds in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Cairns was again the star. He hit sixes in all three games, with one of them leaving Wellington's Basin Reserve and ending up in a busy street outside the ground.\nIn the 1983/84 home series against England Cairns took his best test figures of 7-143 off 45 overs in the first test at the Basin Reserve, Wellington. After New Zealand's modest first innings total of 219, Cairns took the first five English wickets with only 115 on the board, which put the home side in a strong position on day two. However, a spectacular sixth wicket, 232 run, partnership between Ian Botham (138) and Derek Randall (164) put the visitors in command on day three with New Zealand facing a tough battle over the remaining two days to save the test.\nAt 402\u20138, only 158 runs ahead of England early on day five, defeat for New Zealand seemed likely when Cairns joined Jeremy Coney (174*) at the wicket. In perhaps Cairns' finest test innings, (64), he shared a record ninth wicket partnership of 118 with Coney who went on to score his long-awaited, maiden test century. Cairns, although hitting 10 fours and a six, played a rearguard innings best remembered for its uncharacteristic grit and controlled determination, which helped New Zealand achieve a famous draw against the odds.\nThe New Zealand total of 537 was a record against England and it set the foundation for an emphatic second test win by an innings and 132 runs at Lancaster Park, Christchurch, where the visitors failed to reach 100 in either innings. After a drawn third test at Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand achieved its first test series win over England.\n\n\n=== Injury and playing ===\nCairns suffered a horrific injury when he came out to bat without a helmet against Pakistan in the Third Test in Dunedin in 1984/85. He was felled by a sickening blow to the back of the head from 19-year-old paceman Wasim Akram. After retiring hurt, Cairns was hospitalised with a suspected hairline fracture of the skull and complained of 'dizzy spells' for months afterwards. In testament to his courage, Cairns was 'padded up', this time with a helmet, ready to return to the crease, as New Zealand fought another famous rearguard action to win the test and series. History showed he was not required as Jeremy Coney (111*), this time supported by number eleven Ewen Chatfield (21*), took New Zealand to victory by two wickets.\nCairns recovered to play in the World Championship of Cricket in Sydney and Melbourne in February 1985. A highlight for Cairns was his fine innings against eventual champions India in the semi-final at the SCG (39 out of a total of 206, but with no sixes). In March he left for his last major tour as a frontline player for New Zealand, a harrowing trip to the West Indies where New Zealand lost heavily against the often brutal fast bowling of the homeside. Cairns played in only the first two tests of the four test series taking only five wickets at an average of 63.00. At aged 36 his decline as an international player seemed inevitable.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nHis final series for New Zealand was a personal anti-climax for this immensely popular cricketer. The historic 1985/86 test series win in Australia saw Cairns play only in the deciding third test in Perth. Although playing in his usual spirited fashion, Cairns failed to take a wicket, nor score a run, in this his final international game. Despite Cairns' disappointment, New Zealand won by six wickets to take the series 2\u20131, and it was fitting, considering his unselfish service to New Zealand cricket since 1974, that Cairns was part of this 'ultimate' triumph.\nStill a sentimental crowd favourite, he was nevertheless left out of the New Zealand World Series Cup squad which returned to Australia in January 1986. This unpopular decision, albeit inevitable due to injury and loss of form, spelled the end of his international career. Like long-standing captain Geoff Howarth at the beginning of the summer, Cairns was forced into retirement, and somewhat controversially denied the dignity of choosing his own 'time to go'.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCairns has been profoundly deaf since age 17, which he blamed on working in noisy conditions. In December 2009 he was fitted with a cochlear implant. He is the Ambassador for The National Foundation for the Deaf Inc. and is instrumental in raising awareness for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing communities.\nCairns was the subject of an episode of the TVNZ production This is your life in 1998 which was presented by Paul Holmes.Following his retirement from cricket, Cairns concentrated on his golf skills and became a low-handicap golfer known for his extremely long drives. After relocating to Gisborne, he met and later married Carol Edwards, who died in 2008 from cancer. He represented Poverty Bay-East Coast at New Zealand Masters tournaments.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLance Cairns at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Brett Lee (born 8 November 1976) is an Australian former international cricketer, who played all three formats of the game. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world.\nIn each of his first two years, Lee conceded fewer than 20 runs for every wicket taken, but later recorded figures in the low 30s. He was an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batsman, with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket. Lee finished his Test career with 310 wickets, and his One Day International career with 380 wickets. Considered one of the best bowlers of his generation, only Muttiah Muralitharan took more ODI wickets than Lee from 2000-2009.Lee played for the Australian team that won the 2003 World Cup. He played his first Test in 1999 and retired from international cricket on 12 July 2012. He subsequently declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales, but continued to play Twenty20 matches for several seasons after, notably in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Big Bash League.In January 2015, Lee announced his retirement from all forms of the game, effective at the end of the 2014\u201315 Big Bash League season. He has since found work as a film actor and a Fox Sports commentator.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nLee started playing in the junior teams of his local side, Oak Flats Rats, and gradually worked his way up the ranks. He also played for Middleton cricket before he played first class career.\nAt 16 he began playing first grade cricket for Campbelltown, where he managed to claim the wickets of a few New South Wales cricketers, and Mosman, where at one point, he shared the new ball with Shoaib Akhtar and briefly played alongside England batsman Andrew Strauss.Lee was called up to the Australian Under 17 & 19 teams. In March 1994, he was forced out of the Australian under-19 team to tour India due to stress fractures in his lower back and it forced him to remodel his bowling action to minimise the impact on his back. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the AIS Australian Cricket Academy in the 1995\u201396 season. His contemporaries included fellow internationals Jason Gillespie and Mike Hussey.Prior to making his first-class debut, Lee played for Mosman in the final of the 1996\u201397 Sydney Grade Cricket competition.Lee was first named in the New South Wales Blues squad as the twelfth man for the 14\u201316 November match against Queensland in the 1997\u201398 Sheffield Shield. The following week, he made his first-class debut for the Blues against Western Australia and took 3 wickets at 114, including that of the captain Tom Moody. It would be his only appearance in the Sheffield Shield for the rest of the season. He ended a memorable month by taking a 5-wicket haul in the Sydney grade Limited-Overs Cup final against Bankstown on 30 November.During the 1998\u201399 season Lee was a more regular presence in the latter stages of the Sheffield Shield. He took 14 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul against Tasmania in the second innings. He started the 1999\u20132000 season by claiming 8 wickets in his first two matches. Such performances impressed his New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh, who was then Australia captain, and culminated in his Test debut in December 1999. He finished the season as the Blues' second-highest wicket taker in the Pura Cup with 24 wickets in 5 matches.After a successful Test series against India, Lee returned to domestic cricket and was named in the 2008 Pura Cup final. He hit his career best batting score, 97 against Victoria in the Blues' second innings and scored a record 176-run partnership with Beau Casson. In Victoria's second innings, he took 4\u201372, dismissing the last four tailenders, as the Blues won the final.\nIn 2009 he battled back from injury and was a key player in New South Wales' success during the Champions League Twenty20. During the final he played an important part with both bat and ball and was named Man of the Match. He also won the Man of the Series award.Following his retirement from Test cricket, Lee stopped playing first-class cricket to concentrate on the limited-overs formats. He was the Blues' highest wicket-taker in the 2010\u201311 Ryobi One-Day Cup with 15 wickets and had the second best economy rate of the top five wicket-takers despite missing the latter stages of the campaign due to international duty.\nIn June 2012 he declined to renew his contract with the Blues, ending his 15-year association with his domestic team.He retired from Big Bash League after playing in the final for the Sydney Sixers on 28 January 2015. In the dramatic final over, he took two wickets clean bowled in successive deliveries, and his hat-trick ball, the sixth of the over, resulted in a missed run out and the Perth Scorchers win by 4 wickets.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Debut days ===\nOne month after making his first class debut, Lee was chosen to represent the Australian A team on a tour of South Africa. He claimed two wickets but in that match stress fractures in his back from the previous injury re-opened and Lee was in a back brace for over three months.\n\n\n=== Test career ===\nBy the late 1990s there were calls for Lee to be included in the national squad. Captain Steve Waugh, who also played with him for New South Wales, was impressed by Lee's debut and pushed for his inclusion into the national team. He was eventually chosen in the final 14 for the Test series against Pakistan in 1999 but failed to make the starting 11. By the time the Test series against India came around, he was twelfth man. However, he duly made his Test debut for Australia in December 1999 against the touring Indians, becoming Australia's 383rd Test cricketer.\nBowling first change, Lee took a wicket in his first over in Test cricket when he bowled Sadagoppan Ramesh with his fourth delivery. He also captured Rahul Dravid in his first spell before returning to take three wickets in six balls to finish the innings with figures of 5/47 from 17 overs, becoming the first Australian fast bowler since Dennis Lillee to take 5 wickets on debut. Lee took 13 wickets in his opening two Tests at the low average of 14.15.\nLee won the inaugural Donald Bradman Young Player of the Year Award at the Allan Border Medal award ceremony in 2000 soon after his debut.\nLee took 42 wickets in his opening three series, the most by any Australian bowler in the seven matches he played. He was selected for the Test series against the West Indies in late 2000. During the first Test he scored his first half-century in test cricket and in the next Test, took seven wickets including a five wicket haul in the second innings. However, he suffered a stress fracture of the lower back which kept him out of the next three Tests. He returned against Zimbabwe but soon suffered another setback a month later when he broke his right elbow and was sidelined until May 2001.\n\n\n==== Return from injury ====\nLee returned to the international team for the 2001 Ashes series after recovering from an elbow injury. His comeback saw less success than his debut, managing only nine wickets in five Tests at 55.11. However, Lee was back as Australia's leading wicket-taker in the first and third Test against New Zealand later that year, in a series which he captured 5 wickets in the second innings and made a contribution of 61 with the bat in the first Test match. The series ended in a 0\u20130 draw. He finished the series with 14 wickets at 25.14. The two home and away series against South Africa were not as productive, yielding 19 wickets in six Tests at 38.42.\nLee only took five wickets in a match on three occasions between the New Zealand series and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Lee came under pressure for his position after taking only five wickets at 46.50 in the three-Test series against Pakistan in 2002. Andy Bichel, who was filling for the injured Jason Gillespie, took eight wickets at 13.25. With the other frontline bowlers all taking wickets at less than 13, Lee was dropped when Gillespie returned for the first two Tests during the 2002\u201303 Ashes series. He returned for the Perth Test, after claiming a five wicket haul in a Pura Cup match against Queensland for New South Wales. He took thirteen wickets at 41.23 in three matches, compared to Bichel's ten at 35.1. After the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Lee took 17 wickets at 28.88 in four Tests against the West Indies. It was the first series in two years where he averaged under 30, and only the second in that period where he averaged under 40.\nAfter a mid year break, he participated in a Two Test series against Bangladesh in northern Australia. He took six wickets at 31.66, and was Australia's most expensive bowler, with the other specialist bowlers averaging 15.55 against the lowest ranked team in Test cricket. He followed this with six wickets at 37 in a comfortable 2\u20130 Test series against Zimbabwe, in which the other specialist bowlers averaged 23.15.Against the Indian batting line-up in the 2003\u201304 home series, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw for Australia, Lee was out of the first two Tests recovering from a torn abdominal muscle, an injury which he sustained during the Zimbabwe series.\n\n\n==== Loss of Test position ====\nLee took eight wickets in 100 overs in the final two Tests against India, at an average of 59.50. This Test included a double century to Sachin Tendulkar in the Indians' first innings of 7/705 where Sachin and V.V.S. Laxman freely attacked Lee and other bowlers in the final Test in Sydney. He ended the series with the worst average and economy rate of Australia's front line bowlers.He was subsequently replaced by fellow fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz in 2004 during the tour of Sri Lanka when Lee's ankle injury worsened, forcing him to return home to have surgery. This injury would force Lee out of the game for 4\u00bd months to ensure his full recovery.\nLee's form in the Test arena had been ineffective, and from July 2001 to January 2004, he had a Test bowling average of 38.42, compared to an average of 16.07 in his earlier career.\nLee was unable to reclaim his position for eighteen months, when Kasprowicz took 47 wickets at 23.74 in thirteen Tests, taking his wickets at a much lower cost than Lee had done in the previous three years. This included 17 wickets at 26.82 on the spin friendly pitches of the Indian subcontinent, helping Australia to its first whitewash in Sri Lanka, and its first series win in India for 35 years.\n\n\n==== Test return ====\n\nAfter 18 months on the sidelines, Lee returned to the Test team in the 2005 Ashes series. With Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie both struggling for form, Lee returned to take the new ball with Glenn McGrath. He averaged 40 with the ball for the series, which some commentators have put down to having to bowl longer spells than he was accustomed to at the time, but was retained, in part because of his defiant batting which yielded runs at an average of 26.33. During the Ashes, he claimed his 150th test wicket off Andrew Strauss with a straight yorker on Day 1 of the third test.\nPart of Lee's difficulty at Test level is that the benefits of his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has tried to concentrate solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.\nIn the 2005-06 Australian cricket season, Lee's Test figures improved from his 2001\u201304 difficulties, with a season bowling average of 25.74.\nDuring South Africa's 2005\u201306 tour of Australia, Lee's form saw a steady improvement, with figures of 5/93 in the first Test at Perth. He finished the three Test series with 13 wickets and of the Australian bowlers, was second only to Shane Warne's 14 wickets in the series. Three Australian players including Lee, who was reprimanded in the Third Test in Sydney for showing dissent towards umpire Aleem Dar.With the unavailability of Glenn McGrath for the tour of South Africa in March\u2013April 2006, Lee became the spearhead of the Australian bowling line-up. In the second Test of that series, at Durban, Lee captured his 200th Test wicket in his 51st match and also captured figures of 5 for 69, on the back of 49 Test wickets in 2005. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was unable to maintain his performance when Australia visited Bangladesh for a two Test series, taking two wickets at 93, coming bottom of Australia's bowling averages.In the first three tests of the 2006\u201307 Ashes series, he only took eight wickets and was fined for excessive appealing in the Third Test in Adelaide when a LBW decision was not in his favour. However, during the week period between the Adelaide and Melbourne tests, he worked with Troy Cooley, Australia's bowling coach, to adjust his run up and came back in the 4th and final tests with more wickets. He finished the series 20 wickets, with his best bowling figures being 4 for 47 at an average of 33.20, including 6 in the final test. His tally was only bettered by his teammates Stuart Clark, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath as the quartet claimed more wickets than the entire England bowling attack combined.\n\n\n==== Post McGrath-Warne era ====\nFollowing the retirements of Warne and McGrath, Lee rose to the challenge and was awarded the Man of the Series in the inaugural Warne-Muralidaran Trophy, a two-Test series against Sri Lanka in late 2007. In his first series as bowling spearhead reaped 16 wickets at an average of 17.5. This was achieved by bowling 5 km/h (3.1 mph) slower to improve accuracy. In the following series Lee took 24 wickets at 22.58 in four Tests against India. In this series he overtook Jason Gillespie to become Australia's 5th highest wicket taker. His consistent efforts saw him rewarded with the Man of the Series Award for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007\u201308. He capped off the season by winning the Allan Border Medal, the award given to the player adjudged Australia's best international cricketer of the past year.\nLee seemed underdone in the 2008 Australian tour of the West Indies, taking only 5 wickets in the first Test match, during which he seemed exhausted. He returned to productivity, taking eight wickets in the Second test, including a 5 wicket haul, and 6 in the Third Test.\nDuring the Indian tour, Lee picked up a stomach virus and was unable to find his best form throughout the series. Lee showed glimpses of his best form when the team returned to Australia for a two test series with New Zealand, but generally seemed down on pace. However, he struggled in the two tests he played of the series with South Africa, which Australia lost 2\u20131, likely due to a niggling ankle injury and then a stress fracture he developed during the series (both in his left foot). The fracture broke completely during the second innings of the Boxing Day Test-match and he was forced to return home for surgery.\nBy the time he returned to the Australian team for the Ashes in 2009, his position as spearhead had been usurped by the left armer Mitchell Johnson. Additionally, the arrival of bowlers like Peter Siddle, Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger ensured that Lee had to fight for a position in the team. However, he took six wickets in the first innings against the England Lions team in a practice match leading up to the Ashes. Lee was the only bowler to get reverse swing in this match and appeared to be in line for selection for the First Test at Cardiff. However, he picked up a left side strain and a sore rib in this match and he was ruled out of the first three Tests. He was then overlooked for a recall and never played test cricket again, announcing his retirement from test cricket at the beginning of 2010.\n\n\n==== Retirement ====\nLee had been considering retiring from Test cricket for some time since 2008 due to the physical strain. In February 2010, he announced his retirement from Test cricket after consulting friend and England rival Andrew Flintoff, stating that bowling \"at 150 km/h for five days is very hard on the body\". He had been out with a string of injuries and had not played a Test since December 2008. He ended his Test career with 310 wickets in 76 tests, at the time the fourth highest Australian total behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee.\n\n\n=== One-day International career ===\n\nLee made his One Day International debut for Australia against Pakistan on 9 January 2000 during the Carlton and United Breweries Series at the Gabba, Brisbane. He became the 140th ODI cricketer to represent Australia. In February 2002 against South Africa, he scored his first ODI half century, 51* not out.\nIn One-day Internationals, he was ranked by the ICC as the No. 1 ODI bowler in January 2006 and has been ranked among the top ten ODI bowlers since the start of 2003. His bowling strike rate of around 30 puts him amongst the most incisive in this form of the game. He also has a One-day International hat-trick to his name, achieved in the 2003 World Cup against Kenya. Lee was the first Australian and fourth bowler to ever achieve this feat in World Cup history.\nIn the matches Australia played in the 2005\u201306 triangular one day series, Lee gave a display of his useful batting abilities by making 57 in the second game in a 100 run partnership with Michael Hussey to pull Australia out of a middle order collapse. Lee finished the series with 15 wickets, the third highest tally behind Nathan Bracken and Muttiah Muralitharan.\nHis bowler-fielder partnership with long-time international teammate and wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist yielded 58 wickets in 151 matches, the fourth highest of all time in ODI history.\n\n\n==== 2003 World Cup ====\nWith main bowler Shane Warne banned from the 2003 World Cup the day before the opening match, Lee moved up the pecking order and, together with Andy Bichel and Glenn McGrath, formed one of the tournament's most lethal attacks, claiming 59 wickets between them. Lee concluded the tournament with 22 wickets off 83.1 overs at an average of 17.90, a wicket behind Sri Lankan left-arm fastbowler Chaminda Vaas. Lee also had a third leading strike-rate of 22.68 behind West Indian fast bowler Vasbert Drakes and Australian counterpart Andrew Bichel who topped the strike-rates with 19.43 and 21.37 respectively. He also reached the 160 km/h (99 mph) mark thrice; his delivery to Marvan Atapattu in the semi-final reached 160.1 km/h (99.5 mph) and hit 160.7 km/h (99.9 mph)160.6 km/h (99.8 mph) in his second over against England in the group stage.Lee earned six of his 22 wickets during the group stage, 11 wickets during the Super-six stage, 3 from the semi-final and 2 wickets from the final which Australia won. He took one five-wicket haul, 5 for 42, against Trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand during their super-six encounter at Port Elizabeth to put Australia ahead after a dismal innings. He also earned his first international hat-trick with figures of 3 for 14 against Kenya during the last match of the super-six stage.\n\n\n==== Comeback ====\nAfter having to return home due to injury during the 2007 World Cup, Lee traveled with the squad to England for the 2009 \"English summer\" tour. He was left out of the test side during the Ashes but was in the one-day side for the NatWest Series in September. He was the highest wicket-taker for Australia with 12 and also took his ninth five-wicket haul in ODIs as Australia made a clean sweep winning all except one match in the series. With that five-wicket haul, he became the first person to take two five-wicket hauls in ODIs at Lord's; the ball used is now on display at Lord's MCC Museum. Later that month he was a part of the successful 2009 ICC Champions Trophy squad and was level on 6 wickets with teammates Peter Siddle and Shane Watson, the highest total for the Australian team. Injuries sustained in test matches forced him out until 2011, having not played for Australia for almost two years. In the subsequent ODI series, his return was more successful. He finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 11 scalps at 24.00, his series best figures of 3/27 coming in the third match at the SCG. His pace was consistently around the mid 140s km/h and on occasion he once again managed to break the 150 km/h (93 mph) mark..\nDespite competition from younger bowlers and another injury setback, Lee managed to make the squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He finished the tournament with 13 wickets, the highest of all the bowlers in the team. Of the 13 wickets, 4 came in the match against Pakistan but it was not enough as Australia lost the match and eventually crashed out at the quarterfinals to rivals India.\nAgainst the West Indies in March 2012 he hit his highest score, 59 before getting caught off a ball by Kemar Roach. His final ODIs were during the 2012 tour of England and Ireland. During the match against Ireland he opened the bowling and bowled William Porterfield and Ed Joyce in only his first three deliveries.\n\n\n==== Retirement ====\nUpon his retirement from international cricket, Lee had played in 76 Tests, 221 ODIs and 25 T20Is, and had equaled Glenn McGrath's run of 380 wickets in ODI matches \u2013 the highest for Australia.In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's. In 2018, during his commentary for BT Sport in the 2017-18 Ashes series at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Lee revealed that he is an honorary member at Lord's, but not a lifetime member on his home ground at the SCG.\n\n\n=== Twenty20 ===\nLee made his Twenty20 and T20 International debut on 15 February 2005 against New Zealand in the first ever T20 international match. He was called up to the squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. During the tournament, he made history by claiming the first hat-trick in T20 internationals in the Group F match against Bangladesh and also won the Man of the Match award.\n\n\n=== Bowling style ===\nLee was known for his pace and regularly clocked 140 km/h (87 mph) and above. He ranks only behind Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar (161.3 km/h, 100.2 mph) as the fastest bowler of his time. The strain of consistently bowling at 150 km/h (93 mph) caused a string of stress fractures and recurring injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he amassed effectively. Rather than relying on pace alone, he used a wide array of deliveries aimed at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire spells above the 150 km/h (93 mph) mark. His fastest ball was clocked at 161.1 km/h (100.1 mph) against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against West Indies in 2000/01 he bowled a delivery which was clocked at 161.8 km/h (100.5 mph), but this was later shown to be an erroneous measurement of a 142 km/h delivery.Early in his career, Lee was reported for a suspected illegal bowling action, but was cleared, and was also heavily criticised after bowling a series of beamers at batsmen during a number of ODIs in 2005. Captain Ricky Ponting defended Lee saying that it was not intentional. His slower balls also has dramatic falls of pace with varying length, often from a cutter grip, where it can go as slow as 100 km/h (62 mph), but it hovers on average around the 115\u2013130 km/h (71\u201381 mph) range. He is also known to celebrate many bowled wickets with a chainsaw celebration.\n\n\n=== Batting ===\nLee was a competent lower-order batsman. Together with Mike Hussey, he has held the record for highest 7th wicket partnership for Australia in ODIs since 2005\u201306 with 123.During the 2005 Ashes series, Lee had numerous defiant innings, including a stand of 43 not out in the Second Test at Edgbaston, Australia's highest individual score in that innings. This innings nearly won the match for Australia but the other batsman Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind by Geraint Jones and England won by just two runs. After the memorable match, England bowlers Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff went over to console Lee. The image of Flintoff consoling Lee was a moment which came to symbolise a hotly contested series.On 2 April 2006, Lee hit his highest Test score of 64 in 68 balls against South Africa at Johannesburg. His previous highest score in Tests was 62 not out which he made against the West Indies in 2000 at the Gabba. Lee nearly surpassed this score on 3 January 2008 against India when he made 59 off 121 balls. Lee had also once again nearly surpassed his highest test score when he had made 63 not out, but unfortunately Ricky Ponting had declared the innings in the 2nd test against the West Indies. As a result of this, he fell one run short of his highest test score.\nLee's highest score in ODI matches is 59 against West Indies at West Indies in March 2012.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nLee has worked as a bowling coach for Ireland and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2000 Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year\n1999\u20132000 Wisden Young Cricketer of the Year\n2002\u201303 VB Series Player of the Series\n2004\u201305 VB Series Player of the Series\n2005 ICC Awards \u2013 ODI Team of the Year\n2006 Wisden Cricketer of the Year\n2006\u201307 DLF Cup Player of the Tournament\n2006 ICC Awards \u2013 ODI Team of the Year\nAustralia's Greatest ODI XI\n2007 Warne-Muralitharan Trophy Player of the Series\n2007\u201308 Border-Gavaskar Trophy Player of the Series\n2008 McGilvray Medal\n2008 Australian Test Player of the Year\n2008 Allan Border Medal\n2008 ICC Awards \u2013 ODI Team of the Year\n2008 ICC Awards \u2013 Test Team of the Year\n2009 Champions League Twenty20 Player of the Series\n\n\n== Career highlights ==\n\n\n=== Tests ===\nLee's best Test bowling figures of five for 30 came against the West Indies at The Gabba, Brisbane in 2005\nLee's 100th wicket was Marcus Trescothick in his 27th Test against England at Sydney in 2003\nLee took his 200th wicket, Mark Boucher, in his 51st Test against South Africa at Durban in 2006\nHis best batting score of 64 was made against South Africa, Johannesburg, 2006\nHe made his 1,000th Test run in his 53rd Test against Bangladesh at Fatullah in 2006\nLee's 250th wicket was Anil Kumble in his 62nd Test against India at Melbourne in 2007\nLee's 300th wicket was Jamie How in his 73rd Test against New Zealand at Brisbane on 22 November 2008\n\n\n=== One-day Internationals ===\nODI Debut: vs Pakistan, Gabba, Brisbane, 1999\u20132000\n\nHis best ODI bowling figures of five for 22 came against South Africa at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne in 2006.\nHis best ODI batting score of 59 was made against West Indies in 2012.\nHis 100th ODI wicket was Andrew Caddick, against England at the M.C.G. in 2003\nHis 200th wicket was Marcus Trescothick, against England at Lord's in 2005\nHis 300th wicket was Darren Sammy, against West Indies at St George's in 2008\nHis 350th wicket was Nuwan Kulasekara, against Sri Lanka at Kandy in 2011, becoming just the second bowler in Australian history to get 350 wickets.\nLee is the first (and currently the only) bowler to take 5 wickets twice in One Day Internationals played at Lord's\n\n\n== Records ==\nLee was the first player in Twenty20 International cricket to take a hat-trick.\nLee is the second fastest Australian ODI player to take 100 wickets (after Mitchell Starc). He reached the milestone in his 55th match. He is fifth on the world list behind Mitchell Starc (52 matches), Saqlain Mushtaq (53 matches) and Shane Bond (54 matches)\n\n\n== Career best performances ==\n\n\n== Media work ==\nAfter announcing his retirement from international cricket, Lee joined the Channel Nine cricket commentating team, reuniting with former Australia and New South Wales teammate Michael Slater. He also provides support for Slater on The Cricket Show.Lee assisted author Michael Panckridge in the cricket-related Toby Jones novel series.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLee is the second of three sons born to Bob, a metallurgist, and Helen (n\u00e9e Buxton), a piano teacher, and grew up in the Shellharbour suburbs of Oak Flats and Mount Warrigal. His older brother Shane is a retired all rounder and former international and younger brother Grant previously played cricket for New South Wales U-19, and is now an accountant. Lee attended Balarang Public School and Oak Flats High School, which later named its cricket ground in his honour.\nThe brothers first played cricket together in front of their house using a tennis ball and the garage door as the \"wicket-keeper\". As a child he idolised Allan Donald and Dennis Lillee, the latter of whom would become a mentor to him as a teenager.Lee has been known by his nickname 'Binga', after the chain of electronics store Bing Lee, since his high-school days. He was once briefly nicknamed \"Oswald\" by former Australian captain and New South Wales teammate Steve Waugh during his early international career. During an ODI around 2000, he was in the batting order behind his brother Shane and Ian Harvey. When Waugh read out the batting order, instead of reading \"Lee, Harvey, Lee\", he read out \"Lee, Harvey, Oswald\" (Lee Harvey Oswald).Lee married Elizabeth Kemp in June 2006. They have a son. After two years of marriage Lee confirmed his separation from Kemp and they divorced in 2009. At the time of the split, media speculation suggested Kemp was having an affair with a rugby player in Brisbane; however, this was later disputed, with extended periods of loneliness due to Lee's off-season commitments keeping him away from Kemp and his young son given as the reason for the marriage breakdown. He married Lana Anderson in 2014 after one year of dating; they have two children.\nLee is part of the rock band Six & Out. The band is made up of his brother Shane and former New South Wales cricketers Brad McNamara, Gavin Robertson and Richard Chee Quee. Lee plays the bass guitar or acoustic guitar for the band.During the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, Lee wrote the lyrics for \"You're the One For Me\" and recorded it with Indian singer Asha Bhosle. The song reached a peak position of number two on the Indian and South African charts. In 2008, he filmed scenes for his first Bollywood movie Victory.In November 2011, Lee launched his autobiography, which he wrote with the help of author James Knight.Politically, Lee is right wing. In September 2013, he tweeted his support for Tony Abbott, leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in the 2013 Australian federal election. He was approached by the Liberal Party to run as a candidate in the 2019 elections. Lee again endorsed Abbott in the Division of Warringah in the 2019 Australian federal election. In 2014, Lee was criticised after he signed bats for Indian politicians Rajnath Singh, and Sushma Swaraj. The bats were presented by immigration minister Scott Morrison as part of a deal by which India would agree to accept rejected Indian asylum seekers from Australia. Lee however stated that he was a strong supporter of human rights, and that signing these bats did not mean he was not a supporter of them.\n\n\n== Charity work ==\nLee supports a number of charities including the Salvation Army, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and the Make a Wish Foundation, in which Lee was named an 'Official Friend' in honour of his long-standing association with the foundation. He began supporting ADRA along with his brother Shane when a close friend committed suicide.\n\n\n=== Mewsic Foundation ===\nIn 2007, Lee initiated Mewsic, a charitable foundation in India. Mewsic aims to facilitate the involvement of disadvantaged young people in music. Mewsic aims to ensure that music is widely recognised as a powerful tool to heal, empower, educate, and advocate for marginalised children in India. Mewsic has established six centres of music across India.\n\n\n== Film acting ==\nBrett Lee was cast in the Indo-Australian film UnIndian opposite Tannishtha Chatterjee. The film was shot in Sydney.

        "article": "Tino la Bertram Best (born 26 August 1981) is a West Indian cricketer. Since 2002, he has played domestic cricket for his native Barbados, with a season at English club Yorkshire in 2010. Best made his Test debut in May 2003 and played his first One Day International a year later. A back strain incurred in May 2004 prevented Best from playing cricket until March the following year. In 2008 Best signed to play in the Indian Cricket League because he had not played international cricket since 2006. He returned to the side when the West Indies fielded a side weakened by contract disputes between leading players and the West Indies Cricket Board but was dropped shortly after.\nOn his return to the Test side on 10 June 2012, he broke the record for highest score by a number 11 batsman, making 95 against England at Edgbaston.But,later in 2013 his record was surpassed by Ashton Agar who scored 98.  The 143-run partnership with Denesh Ramdin in the same match was also notable; it is the third-highest Test stand with one wicket remaining.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nTino Best made his debut in first-class cricket on 25 January 2002, playing for Barbados against Guyana in the Busta Cup. He opened the bowling with Ian Bradshaw and in the first innings took four wickets for 50 runs (4/50), and Barbados won the match by 162 runs. Best finished his debut season with 17 wickets from 5 matches at an average of 24.29 with a single five-wicket haul.\n\n\n== International breakthrough ==\nAt the time of his Test call up for the Test series against Australia, Best was Barbados' leading wicket-taker in the Carib Beer Cup for the 2002/03 season with 39 dismissals. Though Best was originally drafted in as cover for fast bowler Jermaine Lawson who had chicken pox, when Best made his debut in the third Test he opened the bowling with Lawson. The West Indies lost and Best bowled twenty overs without taking a wicket.After an ineffective first Test, Best was overlooked for the West Indies' overseas tours and drifted out of contention with the emergence of fellow fast bowlers Fidel Edwards and Jerome Taylor. Back at domestic level, he fell out of favour and struggled to be selected for Barbados' Red Stripe Bowl side. While he was infrequently chosen for the one-day team, he improved on his previous season's wicket tally in the first-class competition and finished with 49 wickets including three five-wicket hauls, and was rewarded with a call up to the West Indies side to face England in March 2004. Best's first international wickets came in his second Test, the first in a four-match series against England; his maiden dismissal was that of batsman Graham Thorpe. England won the series 3\u20130 and Best finished as the West Indies' leading wicket-taker in the series (and third overall) with 12 from four matches at a cost of 25.08 runs each.Between June and August 2004 the West Indies embarked on a return tour of England. Best played in the Lord's Test and was stumped off Ashley Giles' bowling after some banter from Andrew Flintoff wound him up sufficiently to try to slog the ball into the windows at Lord's. During the match Best suffered a back strain and was unable to take part in the rest of the series. It was hoped that the fast bowler would recover within a month, however the injury was more serious than initially hoped and he did not play cricket again until March 2005. In the Second Test against Pakistan in June 2005, after a wicketless first innings \u2013 where he had Kamran Akmal caught off a no-ball \u2013 and a second innings spell of 5-0-30-0, Best took four wickets in 11 balls, as Pakistan faltered from 223 for 4 to 309 all out. However, it was not enough to give West Indies the win.\nBest was fined half his match fee in July 2005 for bowling three beamers during a Test against Sri Lanka. He was dropped from the Test side after the July 2005 tour of Sri Lanka. Tino appeared in the cricket movie Hit for Six playing a Barbados cricket player.\n\n\n== International fringes ==\nDespite successful performances for Barbados in domestic cricket by the time Best signed with the rebel Indian Cricket League in February 2008 he had not played international cricket since May 2006. Best played Twenty20 cricket for Mumbai Champs during his spell at ICL, he also played Twenty20 that season for Barbados.In July 2009, there was a pay dispute between the West Indies players and the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). As a result, an understrength squad was picked for the series against Bangladesh: of the 15 players named, which included Best, nine were uncapped. Sriram Veera of ESPNcricinfo noted of his performance on the second day of the first Test that \"[Best] has, in the past, been guilty of trying to bowl faster than what he was capable of and being erratic as a result. Today, he repeatedly hit the short-of-length in the off-stump channel and slipped in the occasional bouncer.\" Those two wickets were his only scalps in the series and he ended up conceding 192 runs. The West Indies lost the series 2\u20130 as Bangladesh secured their first overseas series win. All the players who played for the West Indies during the contract dispute were given central contracts by the WICB, including Best.Best signed a contract with Yorkshire County Cricket Club in April 2010 to represent them until the end of May. After some good performances, his contract was extended, but his form tailed off and he was demoted from opening the bowling, before being dropped from the team at the end of July. In nine first-class matches for the club, Best managed 18 wickets at a cost of 44.05 runs each. He was more successful in Yorkshire's one-day matches, taking ten wickets from five matches at an average of less than 20. In August 2010, Best's central contract was not renewed.Best's domestic performance in the 2011/12 season, in which he took 17 first-class wickets at an average of 20.64, led to his recall to the international squad: in March 2012, Best was selected in the West Indies' ODI squad to face Australia at home. Though he did not play in the series, two months later when the West Indies toured England Best was drafted into the Test squad as cover for injured fast bowler Shannon Gabriel.In July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTino Best at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nTino Best at ESPNcricinfo\nTino Best on Twitter"

        "article": "Fidel Henderson Edwards (born 6 February 1982) is a Barbadian cricketer, who plays all formats of the game. A pace bowler, his round-arm action is \"not unlike\" that of former fast bowler Jeff Thomson. He was spotted in the nets by Brian Lara and was called up for his Test debut against Sri Lanka after just one match for Barbados.\nDespite a promising start to his Test career, he has been injury prone and inconsistent. With an average of just under 40 in Test cricket, he has struggled to fulfil his early potential.\nHe is the half brother of Pedro Collins.\n\n\n== Domestic and T20 franchise career ==\nThe experienced campaigner who also plays in the Bangladesh Premier League was bought by Rajasthan Royals in players auction for IPL 2013 for US$210,000. On 6 February 2009 the IPL franchise of Deccan Chargers bought Edwards for $150,000. His club team in Barbados is YMPC.Edwards was bought for $60,000 by Khulna Royal Bengals to play in the newly formed Bangladesh Premier League to be held in February 2012.Edwards made his first-class debut on 1 February 2002, playing for Barbados against the Windward Islands. In the first innings he opened the bowling with Tino Best; he had to wait until the second to take his only wicket in the match, that of Junior Murray. The Barbados squad had plenty of fast bowlers, with the likes of Best, Pedro Collins, Corey Collymore, Vasbert Drakes, and Ian Bradshaw, who all had international experience by mid-2003.\nOn 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Winnipeg Hawks, with eleven dismissals in six matches. In July 2020, he was named in the Jamaica Tallawahs squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League.In April 2021, he was signed by Peshawar Zalmi to play in the rescheduled matches in the 2021 Pakistan Super League.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Impressive debuts ===\nStrong competition and injury meant Edwards struggled for selection. However, the selectors had monitored his development and in May that year Edwards impressed batsman Brian Lara while bowling in the nets. On the basis of the potential he showed, Edwards was included for the West Indies Test against Sri Lanka the following month. Edwards made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Kingston, Jamaica, making 5 not out and returning with bowling figures of 5/36 and 1/54 in a winning West Indian effort. In his second first-class match, he produced the third-best bowling figures by a West Indies player on debut.In One Day Internationals, his debut was against Zimbabwe at Harare, taking career-best figures of 6/22 off 7 overs; as of January 2015, he is the only player to have taken 6 wickets on their ODI debut and he is only the second player after Tony Dodemaide to have taken 5 wicket hauls in both his test and ODI debuts.\n\n\n=== Injuries ===\nDuring the tour he picked up an injury to his shins, which Edwards felt badly affected his bowling in South Africa. In four Tests against South Africa, he managed eight wickets while conceding 648 runs.In the June 2009 ICC World Twenty20, Edwards suffered a back injury. He suffered a recurrence of the injury when he played for the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League in October of that year. Consequently, his central contract was not renewed and Edwards later underwent back surgery.\n\n\n=== Comeback ===\n\nIn the 2010/11 West Indian cricket season, Edwards made his comeback from injury, taking 22 wickets from 6 matches for Barbados at a cost of 23.77 runs. Having proved his fitness, Edwards was called into the West Indies squad for the first Test against Pakistan in May 2011, almost two years after he was sidelined with a back injury. Though included in the squad, he had to wait until India toured in June before returning to the side. Though he was apprehensive ahead of the first Test, he troubled the Indian batsmen and took four wickets.In March 2012 the West Indies Cricket Board announced that while Edwards was considered whenever Test and T20I teams were selected, he was overlooked in ODIs to manage his workload; he has not played an ODI since 2009.\nEdwards last played a One Day International in 2009, and the West Indies Cricket Board manages his workload to avoid further injuring him. A back injury incurred during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 prevented Edwards from playing international cricket until 2011.\nIn February 2021, Edwards made his comeback to West Indies national team after 8 years as he was named in the T20I squad for Sri Lanka series.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nDiscussing his round-arm bowling action in 2004, Edwards remarked \"I never copied anyone, its just natural. People feel it's a very difficult action but its like riding a bicycle. And the main advantage I get bowling in that fashion is I can swing the ball more, especially the old one. Yes, at times the swing is too wide and a few more extras are added, but I am coping with that.\" His bowling speed is around the late 80s and early 90s mph.  His fastest was clocked at 157.7 km/h in 2003.While his statistics attest to him being a genuine tailender, Edwards has helped save the West Indies three Test matches during his career, forming frustrating last wicket partnerships. The first instance came against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2003, where he hung in for 33 balls to deny the African nation a rare victory. In 2006, Edwards remained at the crease for 36 balls at the Antigua Recreation Ground, with India unable to claim the final wicket, while in 2009 he prevented England from a win at the same ground by remaining unbeaten on five after 26 deliveries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of West Indies cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFidel Edwards at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Shivnarine Chanderpaul (born 16 August 1974) is a Guyanese cricketer of Indian descent and former West Indian international cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. Considered one of the greatest batsmen of his era, Chanderpaul is the first Indo-Caribbean to play 100 Tests for the West Indies.\nChanderpaul captained West Indies in 14 Tests and 16 One Day Internationals. A left-handed batsman, Chanderpaul is well known for his unorthodox batting stance, which has been described as crab-like. He has scored 20,000 runs in international cricket, and in 2008 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and awarded Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy (ICC Cricketer of the Year) by the International Cricket Council.\nHe made his international debut at the age of 19, but did not score a century in international cricket for three years, prompting some criticism. Early in his career, he was plagued by injuries, and was even dubbed a hypochondriac until he had a piece of floating bone removed from his foot in 2000. Since then he has enjoyed consistent form, scoring over 11,000 runs in Test cricket and is currently the 8th highest run scorer of all time in the format.Due to poor performances, Chanderpaul was dropped from the West Indies squad in 2015. After that, he announced his retirement from international cricket in 2016, without a farewell, at the age of 41.\n\n\n== Early life and domestic career ==\nShivnarine Chanderpaul was born to Indo-Guyanese parents Kamraj and Uma Chanderpaul in Unity Village, Guyana on 16 August 1974. His father, Kamraj Chanderpaul, helped to nurture his cricketing ability as a youngster.  His ancestors moved from India to the West Indies as indentured labours under the indentured labour system. By the age of eight, Chanderpaul was playing for his village's cricket team, and would frequently bat for hours, being bowled at by various members of his family. His father initially took him to the Everest club in Georgetown, but there was not a place for him at the club, and so he instead joined the Demerara Cricket Club. He appeared for the club's under-16 side while only ten. He was later given an opportunity at the Georgetown Cricket Club.He made his first-class cricket debut for Guyana at the age of 17, facing Leeward Islands in the 1991\u201392 Red Stripe Cup. He was run out for a duck in his first innings, but scored 90 runs in the second. His List A debut followed a few days later, against Barbados, in which Chanderpaul did not get a chance to bat in a match with no result. He achieved his maiden first-class century in April 1993, playing for the West Indies Board President's XI against the touring Pakistanis. After taking four wickets in the Pakistanis' innings, Chanderpaul was one of three West Indians to score a century, scoring 140 runs, and remaining not out.During this time, he achieved the highest first-class score of his career, in a 1995\u201396 Red Stripe Cup match against Jamaica. In the first-innings of the match, which was eventually drawn, he scored 303 not out from 478 deliveries. In 2007, he subsequently joined Durham as an overseas player, and helped them to collect their first trophy by top-scoring in the final of the Friends Provident Trophy.In March 2008, Chanderpaul caused some controversy when, after batting for Guyana on the first day of a Carib Beer Series match, he left to attend the West Indies Players' Association awards and did not arrive to play the following day. He was 78 not out when he left the match, without notifying his team's manager or coach. He was recorded as retiring out on the scorecard, and later returned on the third day. At the ceremony, Chanderpaul was very successful, winning three awards as the international, Test and ODI cricketer of the year.\n\n\n== International career ==\nDuring the English summer of 1993, Chanderpaul travelled with the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to England. He was the team's most successful batsman during the Test series, scoring 372 runs at a batting average of 124.00, including a score of 203 not out in the first Test, at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. In the 1993\u201394 Red Stripe Cup, Chanderpaul was near the top of the batting averages, and, according to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was a \"contentious selection\" for the subsequent Test series against England, in which he was picked as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks as well as bat. He bowled 16 overs in England's first innings without taking a wicket, and scored 62 runs in the West Indies reply. Chanderpaul played four Tests during his debut series, and was third amongst West Indian batsmen in terms of both runs scored and batting average, getting 288 runs at 57.60.Over the following couple of years, Chanderpaul was in and out of the West Indian Test side, missing a visit by Australia altogether.\n\n\n=== Dominating the arena ===\nIn his first 18 Test matches, Chanderpaul scored 1,232 runs at an average of 49.28, but despite scoring thirteen half-centuries, his highest score was 82; a Test century eluded him. He reached the milestone in his nineteenth Test, scoring 137 against India. Just over a month later, he repeated the feat in One Day International cricket, striking his maiden century in the format, scoring 109 runs, also against India.Chanderpaul scored a further century in each of 1998, in a Test match against England, and 1999, in an ODI against South Africa. In the latter match, Chanderpaul and Carl Hooper were the only West Indian batsmen to reach double figures while batting \u2013 Chanderpaul scored 150, and Hooper reached 108. Their partnership of 226 was at the time, a record in ODIs for the West Indies, and Chanderpaul's individual total is his highest in ODIs. During this early period of his international career, Chanderpaul suffered with a negative reputation. Along with his failure to convert half-centuries into centuries, he had a tendency to miss matches which was perceived as hypochondria. He was also in the news for late-night partying; on one occasion in 1999, he shot a policeman in the mistaken belief that he was a thief. His career took a turn for the positive in 2000, when he had surgery on his foot to remove a floating bone.Free of his foot injury, Chanderpaul enjoyed the best series of his career to that point when he scored centuries in three of the five Test matches against India. In addition to his centuries, he also scored three half-centuries, and batted for a record 1,513 minutes between dismissals. The following year, against Australia, Chanderpaul scored a century from 69 balls \u2013 which at the time was the third fastest Test century. Later in that same series, the two sides scored exactly the same total in their respective first innings, and Australia then reached 417 in their second, leaving West Indies requiring 418 runs to win. No side had ever successfully chased that many runs to win in a Test previously; writing for Cricinfo, Andrew Miller reported at the end of the third day that \"Victory [for the West Indies] is as unlikely as ever, but it remains a remote possibility.\" On the final two days, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Chanderpaul\u2014batting with a broken finger\u2014both reached centuries, and the West Indies completed the record run-chase with three wickets remaining. He subsequently suffered what ESPNcricinfo described as \"an indifferent run\"; despite scoring centuries against South Africa and Bangladesh, he averaged just over 35 across eighteen innings, of which six were against either Bangladesh or Zimbabwe. Facing England at Lord's, Chanderpaul narrowly missed out on a century in both innings in July 2004. He remained not out on each occasion, scoring 128 runs in the first innings, and 97 in the second, but the West Indies were beaten by over 200 runs in the contest.\n\n\n=== Captaincy ===\n\nIn late 2004, Digicel began a sponsorship deal with the West Indies cricket team, and caused division within the squad. Initially, Chanderpaul was one of five players who did not attend a training camp due to disagreements about resulting commercial issues. For the following series against South Africa, seven of the West Indies best players were omitted from the squad due to contractual issues, but Chanderpaul had resolved his differences, and was named as captain in place of Lara, who was one of the missing players. In the first match of the series, Chanderpaul became only the second player, after Graham Dowling, to score a double century on his debut as captain in Test cricket. He remained 203 not out when he declared the West Indies innings closed; the joint-highest score of his Test career. Only a resolute batting performance from Jacques Kallis rescues a draw for South Africa in the match, although Chanderpaul was criticised for both the timing of his declaration, and later, negative field placings. For the second Test of the series, the West Indies were back to full-strength after the seven missing players cancelled their contracts with Cable & Wireless. Despite the return of Lara, Chanderpaul retained the captaincy. The second and third Tests of the series were both won by South Africa, before a high scoring draw in the fourth Test. Responding to South Africa's 588 for six declared, West Indies scored 747, in which Chanderpaul was one of four players to score a century.Less than a year after taking on the captaincy, Chanderpaul resigned the position, citing a desire to concentrate on his batting. Although his batting average during his captaincy was only slightly less than his career average, the West Indies only won one Test match and two ODIs out of thirty matches under his charge. The former West Indian bowler, Colin Croft suggested that Chanderpaul \"was filling a space until some else could take over the mantle.\" Chanderpaul's stint as captain was generally criticised in the press; Nagraj Gollapudi, writing for ESPNcricinfo described his style as unconvincing, while Ian Chappell claimed that the West Indies needed a \"father figure\", rather than Chanderpaul, who he thought was \"predictable and reactive\".\n\n\n=== Post captaincy ===\nIn early 2007, Chanderpaul recorded his second highest score in ODI cricket, hitting 149 not out in a losing cause against India. Later that year, he was the top-scorer for the West Indies during their series against England, aggregating 446 runs in three Tests at an average of almost 150. His achievements during the series earned him the man of the series accolade, and saw him named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He was especially praised by Wisden for his third instance of batting for 1,000 or more minutes without being dismissed, and for his century in the third Test on a difficult pitch. He scored another century in the fourth match of the series, and was named as the man of the match, despite an England victory. His performances throughout 2007 resulted in him being one of four players short-listed for the ICC Player of the Year award, which was eventually won by Ricky Ponting.\nIn 2008 Chanderpaul continued in his form during the Sri Lankan and Australian tours of the Caribbean. During the 2008 season he rose to be ranked 5th in the Test batting rankings. By the end of the third test against Australia, Chanderpaul became the fourth West Indian batsman to accomplish 8,000 runs in Test cricket as well as rising in the ranks to 2nd of the ICC test rankings, just 4 points shy of becoming the world's number 1 ranked batsman. In the Test match series against the Australians, Chanderpaul had amassed 442 runs in 6 innings, in 3 of which he had remained not out, at an average of 147.33, including two centuries and three half-centuries. From the West Indies second innings in the first Test, he was not dismissed until the final day of the series \u2013 more than 1,000 minutes of batting without losing his wicket \u2013 the fourth time he has achieved this feat in Test cricket.\nIn December 2013, Chanderpaul scored his 29th test century against New Zealand in the 3rd test match at Hamilton to equal Donald Bradman's number of centuries. In the process, Chanderpaul also became the sixth highest run-scorer in Test matches, overtaking Allan Border's 11,174 runs. This was also his 17th unbeaten test ton, a new record \u2013 one more than Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar(16 unbeaten tons).\n\n\n=== Late career ===\nIn July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's. During the Third Test against New Zealand, he was out stumped by BJ Watling, the first time in his 20-year career that he had ever done so in any form of the game. In a test series against Bangladesh in 2014, Chanderpaul continued to show his durability by achieving scores of 85*, 84* and 101*.\n\nOn 23 January 2016, Chanderpaul announced his retirement from international cricket. Aged 41 at the announcement, Chanderpaul did not play for West Indies since May 2015, and his subsequent exclusion was cited to be a result of poor performances in the home series against England, in which he averaged 15.33 in 3 matches. He was also dropped from the WICB contract in December 2015, signalling the selectors' intention to move forward with younger players, despite the fragility of the West Indies middle order.\n\n\n== Personality and style ==\n\nChanderpaul is well known for his unorthodox batting stance, in which he stands facing the bowler, as opposed to most batsmen who stand side-on. He adopts this stance in order to see the ball clearly with both eyes, something he developed as a child when facing hostile fast bowling. Despite this, when he began playing Test cricket, he had a reasonably traditional stance, with his feet only angling slightly forwards. After a year of playing international cricket, he had eliminated the forward angle, and his feet pointed square of the feet in a classical stance. Between 2000 and 2005, he started to rotate his feet forwards, until they eventually pointed almost directly down the wicket, a position he has maintained since. While he faces forwards, his bat is angled towards square-leg, prompting Scyld Berry to describe his stance as \"perfectly orthodox... provided the bowler delivers from next to the umpire at square-leg, not the one at the bowler\u2019s end.\" Chanderpaul's stance has frequently been described as \"crab-like\", and his batting has been labelled as ugly. It has been suggested that these factors have resulted in him being underrated as a batsman. When the ball is delivered, Chanderpaul moves into a more traditional position to play the ball.As his stance has developed throughout his time playing international cricket, his batting aggression has undergone a similar transformation. He was first selected for the West Indies based on his attacking style of play; he cites Rohan Kanhai as one of his early influences. It was from Kanhai that Chanderpaul took his nickname, \"Tiger\". He maintained this style during the early part of his international career, but as the batting of the West Indies side around him grew weaker, he developed a more defensive style of play, and turned himself into what ESPNcricinfo's Vaneisa Baksh described as \"the anchor of the team, the solid man.\" The Australian spin bowler Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as \"a bloke you needed to crowbar away from the crease,\" and he is often labelled as \"limpet-like.\"\n\n\n== After retirement ==\nOn 27 January 2017, Chanderpaul signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire. Following a successful campaign with the club in 2017 \u2013 a season in which he scored three centuries \u2013 Chanderpaul decided to extend his contract with Lancashire by signing a one-year deal for the 2018 season. He is also still committed to playing First Class cricket for his native Guyana for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n== International centuries ==\n\nChanderpaul scored 30 Test centuries, including two double centuries, and reached the 100-mark 11 times in One Day International matches. He scored 77 first-class centuries.\n\n\n== Achievements and statistics ==\nAs of October 2016 holds the record of achieving the most times the feat of scoring fifty runs or more in both the innings of a test and remain unbeaten (or not out) (4 times).\nMost career runs in test cricket when batting at number 5 position with 6,883 runs.\nChanderpaul along with Stuart Williams holds the record for registering the highest opening runstand for West Indies in ODIs(200*)\nIn 2018 Chanderpaul was granted an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of the West Indies at St Augustine.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShivnarine Chanderpaul at ESPNcricinfo\nExtensive profile on The Cricket Monthly"

        "article": "Herschelle Herman Gibbs (born 23 February 1974) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer, who played all formats of the game for fourteen years. A right-handed batsman, mostly opened the batting, Gibbs became the first player to hit six consecutive sixes in one over in One Day International (ODI) cricket, doing so against the Netherlands in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He held the record for the highest score in a successful run-chase (175*) until it was beaten by MS Dhoni.\nRegarded as one of the most naturally talented cricketers South Africa have ever produced, Gibbs was also known as an excellent fielder, like his compatriot Jonty Rhodes, with former Australian captain Ricky Ponting noting that in his opinion Gibbs is better than Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the eighth highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the tenth highest success rate.He was the fifth international franchise player signed to the Caribbean Premier League and the first South African player to be named to the new Twenty20 tournament.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGibbs was schooled at St Joseph's Marist College and then Diocesan College in Rondebosch.  Gibbs was a gifted sportsman at school featuring in SA Schools teams for rugby, cricket and soccer.\nAt Diocesan College Gibbs played for their First Rugby XV in the same team alongside Robbie Fleck, Selborne Boome and Dave von Hoesslin who would all go on to become Springboks.\nOn 8 June 2007 he got married in St Kitts to Tenielle Povey, but divorced soon afterwards.\n\n\n== International career ==\nGibbs has scored two double centuries in his Test career, both contrasting innings. His first was an innings of 211 not out against New Zealand at Jade Stadium in 1999. His innings took 468 balls while his second double century, 228 against Pakistan came off just 240 balls. In that innings in Newlands, he reached a national record partnership of 368 with Graeme Smith. He has put on a further two 300-run opening stands with his captain, making them the only pair in Test history to break 300 on three occasions. He also holds the South African second wicket record, a partnership of 315* with Jacques Kallis.\nGibbs famously dropped a catch in a World Cup game against Australia in 1999, when he attempted to throw the ball up into the air in celebration before he had full control of it. The player that he dropped, Steve Waugh, went on to make a century and win the game for Australia, a victory which also gave the Australian side the momentum they required to go on and win the tournament. It was claimed at the time that, immediately after the dropped catch, Waugh had \"sledged\" Gibbs with the statement, \"You've just dropped the World Cup\", but, in his autobiography Out of My Comfort Zone, Waugh denies this. Waugh did state, however, that teammate Shane Warne had noticed that Gibbs had developed a habit of throwing the ball in the air prematurely after taking catches and instructed his colleagues not to leave the crease too quickly if they happened to be caught by Gibbs, just in case the situation that happened to Waugh should actually occur.\n\n\n=== Record breaking ===\nGibbs is one of only ten batsmen in ODI history to score hundreds in three consecutive innings, the others being Zaheer Abbas, Saeed Anwar, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Ross Taylor, Kumar Sangakkara, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Babar Azam. Sangakkara became the only player to hit four consecutive ODI hundreds, during 2015 cricket world cup.  On 6 October 2002, in Potchefstroom, in a match against Bangladeshis, Gibbs had a chance to become the first ever batsman to score four hundreds in a row. South Africa was set the target of 155 for victory, and Gibbs fell just three runs short, finishing unbeaten on 97. With just six runs needed for victory, he had the strike on 96, but Alok Kapali bowled a legside wide that went for four and made his task almost impossible.For his performances in 2004, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.\nOn 12 March 2006, Gibbs played a monumental innings in the 5th ODI against Australia, scoring 175 off just 111 balls leading South Africa to victory. He was batting with Graeme Smith after Boeta Dippenaar was out on 1(3) bowled by Nathan Bracken. This was the highest scoring One Day International match in history and his innings broke several batting records. It was the highest ever score made in an ODI against Australia, beating Robin Smith's effort in 1993. By bringing up his hundred off just 79 balls, he also brought up what was at the time the fastest ever ODI century against Australia. More importantly however, it was the fastest ever hundred by a South African batsman against any opposition, although the record would be broken later in the year by Mark Boucher. It was also the highest ever score by a batsman in South Africa. He scored 126 runs in boundaries, the most ever by a batsman.  This record stood until 11 April 2011, when Shane Watson hit 150 runs in boundaries against Bangladesh.\nIn the match against the Netherlands in the group stage of the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Gibbs hit six sixes in an over off the bowling of Daan van Bunge becoming the first player in One Day International history to do so. Ravi Shastri and Sir Garfield Sobers had previously achieved this feat in first-class cricket but to date no player has achieved this in Test Cricket. In doing so, he raised US$1 million for the Habitat for Humanity housing projects as part of a contest run by tournament sponsor Johnnie Walker. It is likely that his being awarded citizenship of St Kitts and Nevis was due to this feat.\nHis six hitting form continued throughout the tournament and when he hit Jacob Oram into the stands during a Super Eight match he drew level with Australian batsman Ricky Ponting on 28 for most sixes in World Cup history.\n\n\n=== Struggle with form ===\n\nIn the past two series against England and the West Indies he was brought down the order from the opening batsman to the middle order due to lack of form. After the move he regained form and looked more comfortable batting against the older ball.\nOn 22 April 2006, Gibbs paid the price for his recent run-drought, and was dropped for the second and third Tests against the New Zealand cricket team. He has been short of confidence in Test cricket of late, and scored only 6 and 2 in the First Test at Centurion Park.  South Africa's chief selector, Haroon Lorgat said, \"We had a meeting and agreed that a break and a fresh start next season will do him a world of good.\"  This decision was widely viewed as a harsh one.\nHe came back into the side in the middle order but continued to struggle for runs. On the conclusion of the 1st Test against Pakistan in January 2007 he had gone over 2 years without scoring a century. He had come close on many occasions to ending the drought, getting out in the nineties four times.\nYet, for his performances in 2008, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.In April 2009, his sixteen One Day International innings since the March 2008 one-day series in Bangladesh having yielded just three fifties, even Stuart Hess, his most ardent media supporter, was moved to cast doubt over his future.  Hess had famously recommended Gibbs as captaincy successor to Shaun Pollock in 2003, but now, noting that his \"average, as an opener, in that same period is 25.25, more than 10 runs below his overall average of 35.87\", Hess felt \"a sense that Gibbs is living off past deeds and not playing with the requisite form needed to hold on to a national spot.\"  He noted, however, that Gibbs was the only South African with more than 1,000 World Cup runs and that, of the twelve others, only Sachin Tendulkar with 57.93 and Sir Viv Richards with 63.31 had better averages:\n\nPerhaps putting up with Gibbs's current inconsistent streak may just have to be the pay-off South Africa have to make if it means he can help guide the national side to greater glory in two years time.\nAfter being dropped from the side Gibbs stated that he wanted to perform well in the domestic cup and that he was feeling well about it. He stated that his aim was to play in the 2011 Cricket World CupHis Test career came to an end following the 2007/08 West Indies tour of South Africa.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\n\n=== County cricket ===\nGibbs played for Glamorgan in the 2008 County Twenty20 tournament where he had a successful time; his highest score being 98 off just 52 balls in a losing game against Northants. He then signed up to play for Glamorgan for the 2009 County season, replacing Mark Cosgrove as the overseas player at the end of June. He also represented Glamorgan in two NatWest Pro40 League matches in that same season.Gibbs then signed for Yorkshire Carnegie for the 2010 Friends Provident t20 tournament, where he was their overseas player, scoring 101 from 53 balls against Northamptonshire to achieve his first century in English T20 cricket.\n\n\n=== Big Bash League ===\nIn the 2011/12 season the Perth Scorchers signed Gibbs for their campaign in the Australian Big Bash League. Gibbs did a brilliant job for the team so much so that they made it to the final. He was the third highest run scorer. He scored 302 runs in 7 matches with an average of 43.14. His prominent batting helped the Scorchers to participate in the Champions League T20 which was held in South Africa during September 2012.\n\n\n=== Indian Premier League ===\nIn April 2008, Herschelle Gibbs joined the Deccan Chargers of the Indian Premier League. His mediocre performance in 2008 season made the Chargers' management put him on sale. However, he came up with splendid knocks in the second season helping the Deccan Chargers ahead with four continuous wins in their first four matches. Of all the openers, Adam Gilchrist and Gibbs have been the most explosive pair. He also played a crucial role in the finals by scoring an unbeaten 53 (48 balls) in the final when Adam Gilchrist went out for a duck. He also took a crucial catch off Mark Boucher at point when the Royal Challengers were cruising to the victory.\nIn the 2012 version of the IPL, he was signed by the Mumbai Indians with a reported fee of US$50,000.\nHis top score is 69* (56) v Chennai Super Kings. In 2012, he scored 66* (46) for the Mumbai Indians.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh Premier League ===\nIn a new T20 championship in Bangladesh, the team of Khulna Royal Bengals in the Bangladesh Premier League bought him for $50000 as their team member on 19 January 2012.\n\n\n=== Kashmir Premier League ===\nIn the inaugural edition Kashmir Premier League 2021, he was the only foreign player to join the tournament.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2001, Gibbs was fined along with several teammates for smoking marijuana during that year's tour of the West Indies.Most notoriously, Gibbs was involved in the match fixing affair with former captain Hansie Cronje, who offered him $15,000 to score \"less than 20\" in the 5th One-Day International of a series. He tearfully claimed to the King Commission of inquiry into corruption in South African cricket that he did not follow through on his side of the bargain, scoring 74 runs. As a result, he was banned for only six months. He repeatedly refused to tour India fearing arrest and refused to even speak to Indian Police over the matter. However, Gibbs was named in the South African squad to tour India in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, and as a result, he had to meet with Indian Police over his involvement in the match-fixing scandal.On 15 January 2007, it was announced that Gibbs, a Cape Coloured himself would face a disciplinary panel after making racist comments during the 1st Test against Pakistan. His words had been picked up on the stump microphone saying remarks such as \"go back to the zoo\" and swearing to the Pakistani players and as a result heard across the world. The comments were said to have been directed at the members of the crowd after teammate Paul Harris had been abused by them whilst fielding. The Pakistani management made an official complaint to referee Chris Broad and Gibbs was banned for two Tests. He appealed against the ban but this was rejected by the ICC's code of conduct commissioner, Richie Benaud. The ban was, however, changed to one Test, one Twenty20 game and one ODI match \u2013 all against Pakistan. In August 2021, he accused BCCI of putting pressure on him to not play in the inaugural edition of the Kashmir Premier League (KPL).\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn July 2019, Gibbs was appointed as the head coach of the Rotterdam Rhinos for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. Prior to this, he also had an experience of coaching teams in Shpageeza Cricket League and Kuwait's national squad. In November 2020, he was selected by the Colombo Kings as the Head Coach for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League. On 2 January 2021 he was selected as a new head coach of Karachi Kings in the PSL.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of international cricket centuries by Herschelle Gibbs\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nHess, Stuart. \"Is Gibbs a risk worth taking?\" IOL, 8 April 2009.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHerschelle Gibbs at CricketArchive\nHerschelle Gibbs at Cricinfo"

With seven wicket hauls in his test career, he holds the record for taking the most number of five wicket hauls by Zimbabwean bowler in test cricket.He was part of the golden era of Zimbabwe cricket between 1997 and 2002. His relationship with Zimbabwe Cricket had soured in several occasions during his international career as well as during his coaching career.He was the head coach of Zimbabwe until early 2018 and was the bowling coach for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League in 2018.\nIn September 2018, Streak submitted an application to the court to have Zimbabwe Cricket liquidated in relation to outstanding debts.In April 2021, Streak was handed an eight-year ban by the ICC for corruption.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and hails from a family background which primarily involved in ranching in Bulawayo. He completed his education at the Rhodes Estate Preparatory School and Falcon College. His father Denis Streak was also a first-class cricketer. He also had a learner hunters' license.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nHe made his first-class debut for Zimbabwe B against the touring Kent team on 30 March 1993 at Harare Sports Club.In 1995/96, Streak played in the same Matabeleland team as his 46-year-old father Denis in the final of the Lonrho Logan Cup against Mashonaland Country Districts; this was the first instance of a father and son playing in the same first-class match for more than thirty years. Matabeleland eventually crowned as champions of the 1996 Logan Cup. He made his T20 debut representing Warwickshire against Glamorgan on 8 July 2004.He was appointed as the captain of Warwickshire in 2006 after signing a two-year contract. However, on 25 April 2007, Streak resigned as Warwickshire captain after featuring in just one match in the 2007 county season, indicating that captaining the side was affecting his on field abilities. He was replaced as captain by Darren Maddy. At the end of the 2007, season he left Warwickshire citing family reasons.At the end of the year of 2007, Streak joined the Ahmedabad Rockets in the controversial Indian Cricket League which ultimately ended his international career. He was also barred from playing in the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008. He played two seasons in the ICL along with appearing in the Hong Kong Sixes. In 2009, Streak cut his ties with ICL after the tournament was discontinued.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nStreak made his ODI debut on 10 November 1993 against South Africa. A month later, he made his test debut in Zimbabwe's tour of Pakistan 1993/1994 (on 1 December 1993). He made his mark in international cricket by taking 8 wickets in the 2nd Test at Rawalpindi (9\u201314 December 1993). Streak won the Player of the series award on his debut test series for his impressive performance with the ball taking 22 wickets at an average of 13.54. It is also the most number of wickets taken by a Zimbabwean bowler in a test series.\n\n\n=== Rising through ranks ===\nStreak bettered his best bowling figures in 1995 when Pakistan toured Zimbabwe, taking 6/90 in the first Test at Harare which Zimbabwe won by an innings. On 13 January 1996 in a test match against New Zealand at Hamilton, he became the fastest Zimbabwean bowler to take 50 test wickets in 11 matches. He was also part of Zimbabwe side which secured first test win against Pakistan in Pakistan soil in 1998. In 2000/2001, he won 2-man of the series awards, first in Zimbabwe's tour of England and then in Bangladesh's tour of Zimbabwe. In a test match in 2000 against England at Lord's, he picked up 6/87 and became the first and only Zimbabwean to take a fifer at Lord's. He is also the only Zimbabwean to have sealed his spot in the Lord's honours boards.During his playing days, he used to carry the most weakened and fragile bowling attack of Zimbabwe single-handedly. He also possessed the ability to extract lateral seam movement on the most docile of the pitches. His debut World Cup appearance came during the 1996 Cricket World Cup and was part of Zimbabwe team which reached super sixes stage for the first time during the 1999 Cricket World Cup. He was also part of the Zimbabwean side which finished fifth at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in men's cricket competition and was part of the Zimbabwean side which played in the preliminary match against New Zealand in the inaugural edition of the ICC Champions Trophy in 1998. On 11 June 1999, he became the first as well as the fastest Zimbabwean bowler to take 100 ODI wickets.\n\n\n=== Captaincy ===\nStreak claimed in an interview in The Observer that he was faced with moral challenges in captaining Zimbabwe. He said that he was asked to falsely tell white players that they were not talented enough and were to be replaced by black players.He was appointed as the captain of Zimbabwe side in 2000 for both test and ODI formats. During his captaincy tenure, he embroiled in tensions with the cricket board over pay and quota issues which also caused him to step down from captaincy in 2001. Under his captaincy, Zimbabwe produced an upset victory against India in a test match in 2001 at home where Zimbabwe secured their first ever test win against India by four wickets. He was also known for his brutal bowling spell of 4/8 in an ODI against West Indies during the 2001 Australia Tri-series where Zimbabwe defeated West Indies by 47 runs in a low scoring affair. On 4 February 2001, in an ODI against Australia he became the first Zimbabwean bowler to take 150 ODI wickets. He along with Andy Blignaut set the highest seventh wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in test cricket by adding 154 runs during a test match against West Indies in July 2001 at Harare. On 7 October 2001, he along with Andy Flower set the highest seventh wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in ODI by adding 130 runs against England.He was again appointed as the captain in 2002 and he was again under scanner and spotlight in wake of Zimbabwe's political crisis. He captained Zimbabwe team in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy and at the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.He also captained the Zimbabwean team at the 2003 World Cup, a tournament marred by political tensions in Zimbabwe. During the 2003 World Cup, his teammates Andy Flower and Henry Olonga wore black armband in the match against Namibia at Harare Sports Club, to \"mourn the death of democracy\" in Zimbabwe and it also became international headlines. Under his captaincy, Zimbabwe reached super sixes stage in the 2003 tournament. On 23 June 2003, he became the first Zimbabwean bowler to take 200 ODI wickets during an ODI against England.In 2004, he was unceremoniously sacked from the team by the Zimbabwe Cricket Union when he was still the captain of the side due to involving in rebellions and was subsequently replaced by the then 22-year-old Tatenda Taibu as the captain. In the same year, he was nominated for ICC ODI Player of the Year during the 2004 ICC Awards.\nHe was the most successful test captain of Zimbabwe with four wins and he was also the second most successful ODI captain for Zimbabwe with 18 wins.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nHe returned to represent Zimbabwe in March 2005 after a one-year absence from international cricket. He was also part of the Africa XI team during the 2005 Afro-Asia Cup in a 3 match ODI series against Asia XI.Streak retired from international cricket in October 2005 to become captain of Warwickshire County Cricket Club having previously played county cricket for Hampshire. He also captained his fellow exiled players from Zimbabwe in the Red Lions team, which plays charity games in England.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn August 2009, Streak was appointed as the bowling coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team. He was also given the responsibility of working with the young Zimbabwean fast bowlers and for franchise cricket. Fast bowlers such as Kyle Jarvis, Christopher Mpofu, Brian Vitori and Shingirai Masakadza who were groomed and nurtured under his coaching later went onto become regular features in Zimbabwe national side.In 2010, along with his former teammate Grant Flower, Streak became a supporting coach of Zimbabwe under former English cricketer Alan Butcher. Flower became batting coach and Streak was named as bowling coach.\nIn 2013, Streak's contract was not renewed for financial reasons. Zimbabwe Cricket had offered Streak a consultancy role but they could not guarantee him a set number of working days or specific pay which forced him to stay out of the preparations for the Bangladesh series. Finances permitting at his franchise in Bulawayo, the Matabeleland Tuskers, he remained coach there. He was appointed Bangladesh's bowling coach in May 2014 until 2016 for a contract of two years. In 2016, decided not to renew contract with Bangladesh Cricket Board with the intention to become coach of National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. In July 2016, he was appointed as the consultant of Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association Academy.In October 2016, Streak was appointed head coach of the Zimbabwe national cricket team replacing Dav Whatmore. He was tasked with ensuring Zimbabwe qualify for the 2019 World Cup. However, Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the World Cup following the disappointing performance by the team at the 2018 ICC World Cup Qualifier, and Streak was forced to resign in early 2018 with the entire coaching staff was also sacked by the board. The chairman of Zimbabwe Cricket, Tavengwa Mukuhlani also alleged Streak of being racist and insisted that some of his player selections during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers were influenced by the racism. However, Streak refuted the allegations and accused ZC of being unethical and corrupted.In 2018, he was appointed as a consultant for the Scotland side for two matches in a T20I tri-series which also featured Ireland and Netherlands. He also joined Somerset in 2019 as a consultant bowling coach for a short stint. He continued on in his role as bowling coach for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. Previously, he has also served as bowling coach for Gujarat Lions franchise in 2016 and 2017 IPL seasons.In April 2021, Streak was banned from all cricketing activities for 8 years for breaching the ICC's anti-corruption policies. Streak was found guilty of assisting a corruptor known as \"Mr X\" contact players. Streak received two bitcoins (worth around US$ 35,000), and an iPhone as payment from the corruptor in 2017. He was accused of disclosing inside information (non-public information) about the franchise T20 leagues including Indian Premier League, Pakistan Super League and Afghanistan Premier League. Streak himself accepted the ban by the ICC but denied the match fixing claims against him.He also founded the Heath Streak Academy (also better known as Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy Trust) in 2014 which was established for the development and growth of cricket throughout Zimbabwe. He resigned from heading the Heath Streak Academy Trust in 2021 following eight-year ban by the ICC and the academy was later renamed as Zimbabwe Youth Cricket Academy.\n\n\n== Beyond cricket ==\nIn 2005, he conducted an AIDS fundraiser which also included an auction of cricket memorabilia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of African XI ODI cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeath Streak at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Shaun Maclean Pollock OIS (born 16 July 1973) is a South African cricket commentator and former cricketer, who was captain in all formats of the game. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest medium pace bowlers of all time. A genuine bowling all-rounder, Pollock along with Allan Donald formed a bowling partnership for many years. From 2000 to 2003 he was the captain of the South African cricket team, and also played for Africa XI, World XI, Dolphins and Warwickshire. He was chosen as the Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2003.\nOn 11 January 2008 he announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket after his 303rd One Day International on 3 February. Pollock now works as a commentator on SuperSport's coverage of South African cricket.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Prominence ===\nHe is joint 10th in the all-time best ever bowler ratings in the LG ICC Ratings, and has taken over 400 wickets and at the time of his retirement was one of only six players to have scored 3000 runs and taken 300 wickets in Test matches.\nIn June 2007 he represented an Africa XI in an ODI game against an Asia XI in Bangalore. Playing as a specialist batsman, Pollock scored 130 from number 7 in the batting order, the highest ever score by an ODI batsman in that position. The record would however not last long, MS Dhoni bettered it later in the series. In 2007, he received the SA Player's Player award and the SA ODI Player of the Year Award.He was the leading wicket taker for South Africa in Tests until Dale Steyn overtook him on 26 December 2018. He took over 400 test wickets and scored over 3,700 test runs in his 108 Test matches.\n\n\n=== Captaincy ===\nShaun Pollock was a bowling all-rounder. After Hansie Cronje was banned from cricket for life, Pollock took over the captaincy in April 2000. He was eventually removed from the captaincy after South Africa's performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\n\nAlthough no longer captain, he retained his place in the team. After a disappointing Test series tour of Australia in 2005/2006, he faced criticism for losing his wicket taking ability. He has the lowest (best) economy rate of any bowler to have taken 300 ODI wickets, and he is also the first South African and only the tenth player to take 400 Test wickets. In September 2007 he was dropped from the South African test side for the first time in his career. Pollock was later readded to the test series against the West Indies, whereupon he announced his retirement, effective on 3 February 2008. He stated that \"I realise I have been blessed by God and feel I have nurtured my talents to the best of my abilities.\" After South Africa sealed a series victory against the West Indies, Graeme Smith paid tribute to Pollock, stating \"It's very important that people celebrate what he's given to South African cricket and what he's achieved as an individual.\"\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nPollock took four wickets in four balls on his first appearance for Warwickshire \u2013 in a limited-overs (B&H Cup) game v Leicestershire at Birmingham in 1996. \n\nIn Summer 2008 Pollock represented Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League, and Durham Dynamos in the 2008 Twenty20 Cup in England. He played for Durham County Cricket Club in the North East of England and along with fellow South African Albie Morkel was used mainly in the Twenty20 Cup competition.\nOf the 18 players who have bowled at least 2,000 balls for South Africa in ODIs, Pollock's economy rate of 3.65 runs per over was the second best behind that of Fanie de Villiers.\n\n\n== Records ==\nShaun Pollock has the record for the most Test centuries while batting at number 9 or below (2).\nHe also holds the record for playing the most ODI innings before scoring a century (189).\nShaun Pollock also holds the record for becoming the first test captain to be stranded or to be remained unbeaten on 99 in a test innings.\nHe too holds the record for taking the most ODI wickets when playing at home soil (193).\nShaun Pollock holds the record for bowling most Maiden overs in ODI history (313).\n\n\n== Rankings ==\n\nShaun Pollock's career-best ranking and rating in the cricket ratings as determined by the International Cricket Council are as follows:\n\nTest Batting 37th (565)\nTest Bowling 1st (909)\nTest All-rounders 1st (489)\nODI Batting 34th (589)\nODI Bowling 1st (917)\nODI All-rounders 1st (496)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPollock comes from a family of mainly Scottish ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Andrew Pollock, who played for Orange Free State, was born in Edinburgh. He attended Northwood School in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. He is married to Patricia \"Trish\" Lauderdale and has two daughters, Jemma and Georgia. Jemma was born in August 2003, and Georgia in July 2006. Lauderdale was a finalist in the Miss South Africa pageant in the early '90s and also worked for MTN, a South African telecom company. He is a teetotaler and a devout Christian. Pollock is a graduate of the University of Natal with a bachelor's degree in commerce.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShaun Pollock at ESPNcricinfo"

A fast bowler from Jamaica, he played at Test and One Day International (ODI) level for the West Indies during the early 2000s, becoming the fourth West Indian to take a Test hat-trick. Lawson later moved to the United States, and made his debut for the American national cricket team at the World Cricket League Division Three tournament in October 2014.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLawson is a fast bowler capable of bowling over 90 mph. His accomplishments in his first few matches include the rare figures of 6/3 against Bangladesh in his third Test, a hat-trick against Australia in 2003/04, claiming the wickets of Brett Lee, Stuart MacGill and Justin Langer, and a haul of 7/78 against Australia which was important in the West Indian victory in the final Test of that series.\nHowever, his action has been suspect: he was reported for an \"illegal action\" on 11 May 2003 by the International Cricket Council. After remedial work, he returned to Test cricket in mid-2004, but stress fractures and a further reporting of his action in July 2005 have stalled his career to date. However, he was cleared by the International Cricket Council on all reports of \"illegal action\".\nIn the summer of 2007 he joined Great Harwood Cricket Club in the Ribblesdale League as their professional.\nOn 29 Feb 2008 it was announced that Lawson would be joining English side Leicestershire as a Kolpak player for the upcoming county season.\nLawson moved to the USA in 2010 and qualified to play for the USA in 2014.\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Lance Klusener (born 4 September 1971) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer. He was known for his aggressive batting and his fast-medium swing bowling.\nHe is nicknamed \"Zulu\" because of his fluency in the Zulu language. Since his retirement he has occasionally commentated on cricket in both Zulu and Xhosa, as the two languages are mutually intelligible.\nIn September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Domestic career ===\nKlusener played for KwaZulu-Natal (Nashua Dolphins) in the domestic level in South Africa between 1991 and 2004. In 2004, Northamptonshire County Cricket Club signed him on a contract running until late 2008. At Wantage Road he impressed with his fired-up seam bowling and his hard-hitting in the low middle-order. Due to family bereavements back home, it was announced that his contract with the county would not be renewed at the end of the 2008 season. In late 2007, he started playing in the Indian Cricket League Twenty20 tournament in India for the Kolkata Tigers team.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nKlusener made his Test debut for South Africa against India in Calcutta during the second Test in 1996/97. At the time playing primarily as a bowler, Klusener took some fearful hammering in the first innings at the hands of Mohammad Azharuddin, who at one point hit him for five consecutive fours, but Klusener returned what would remain career best figures of eight for 64 in the second.Klusener will be remembered mainly for his contributions in One Day Internationals, in which he became feared as a hard hitting batsman and was voted as Man of the Tournament during the 1999 World Cup. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup. His baseball-style backlift and thunderous hitting symbolised the tournament and his heroics nearly took South Africa to the final. He was also voted as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2000.\nHis international career tapered off after this, due mainly to persistent ankle injuries, as well as a public dispute with the then South African captain Graeme Smith, who at a breakfast meeting shortly after his appointment to the captaincy described Klusener as a \"disruptive force\" to the younger players within the South African national cricket team, with the quote ending up in the South African press. Later Klusener and Smith patched up their differences.He had scored 1,906 runs in 49 matches with a highest score of 174 and 80 wickets with best of 8/64 in Test Matches. In ODI's he scored 3,576 runs in 171 matches at an average of 41.1 with a highest score of 103 and took 192 wickets with a best of 6/49.\n\n\n=== 1999 World Cup ===\nIn the 1999 Cricket World Cup, South Africa had progressed to the semi-finals, and Klusener till then had an excellent tournament, taking 17 wickets and scoring 250 runs (including two half centuries) in 8 matches and building a reputation as a hard-hitting batsman in tight situations.\nHe won four Man of the Match awards out of the nine matches South Africa played in the tournament. The four awards were consecutive with respect to South Africa's wins (one match in between was won by Zimbabwe). The only other South African to win this award in this tournament was Jacques Kallis.\nThe second semi-final was played between Australia and South Africa in Edgbaston, England. Australia, having been put in to bat, set a target of 214 for South Africa to chase in 50 overs. Klusener came in to bat when South Africa were 175/6 in 44.5 overs, and by virtue of his big-hitting (along with support from other batsmen), South Africa entered the final over at 205/9, needing nine runs to win with only one wicket remaining. The two batsmen at the crease were Klusener (on strike) and Allan Donald.\nKlusener scored consecutive fours in the first two balls of the over (bowled by Damien Fleming), levelling the scores and leaving South Africa with only 1 run to win in 4 balls with Klusener on strike. The third ball was a dot, and Donald narrowly escaped getting run out when he backed out too far and tried to get back to his crease. The fourth saw Klusener mis-hit his shot to mid-wicket fielder Mark Waugh. Klusener went for the run, although chances of a run-out were high and two balls were still remaining. However, Donald at the other end, keeping his eyes on the ball and hoping to avoid another mix-up like in the last delivery, did not see Klusener sprinting down the pitch and did not hear the call to run, and Klusener was almost at the bowler's end by the time Donald (who had also dropped his bat) began running. By then, Waugh had thrown the ball to Fleming, who rolled it to Adam Gilchrist who took the bails off at the other end, meaning Donald was run-out by some distance, thus ending the match with the scores level. However, a tie meant that Australia progressed to the final since they had beaten South Africa in the group stages of the tournament. As commentator Bill Lawry put it during the final ball:\n\n \"...this will be out surely \u2013 oh it's out, it's gonna be run out...oh, that is South Africa out \u2013 Donald did not run, I cannot believe it. Australia go into the World Cup Final \u2013 ridiculous running with two balls to go. Donald did not go, Klusener came \u2013 what a disappointing end for South Africa.\" \nAustralia went on to win the tournament; although Klusener's heroics weren't in vain, as he was voted the Player of the Series.In 2014, Klusener stated in an interview that Donald was not to blame for what happened. Klusener stated that he became impatient and, although he made it to the bowler's end, there was genuinely no run. After the match, he was cross at himself and regretted making that run.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nKlusener severed all of his ties with the Indian Cricket League in late 2009 and then completed a Level-three coaching course provided by Cricket South Africa in Spring 2010. Klusener confirmed he was in negotiations with the Bangladesh Cricket Board about becoming the team bowling coach. However, in early September 2010 the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed that they were still awaiting a response from Klusener. Lance Klusener had finally turned down the offer to take over as Bangladesh's bowling coach, replacing Sri Lanka's Champaka Ramanayake. Klusener was reportedly unable to convince his wife about a permanent move to Bangladesh.From 2012 until 2016 he was head coach of the Dolphins, whom he represented in domestic cricket during his playing career,In 2016, he started as batting coach for the Zimbabwe national team. He also coached the Lyca Kovai Kings in India.In July 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Glasgow Giants for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament.In September 2019, Klusener was appointed as the head coach of the Afghanistan national cricket team.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKlusener enjoys fishing. He is also an avid hunter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Africa cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLance Klusener at ESPNcricinfo"

A top-order batsman with a penchant for flashy stroke-play, he was also selected to represent the ACC Asia XI ODI side. Ashraful became the youngest cricketer to make a hundred in test cricket when he was less than 17 years old in 2001, his debut test against Sri Lanka.\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Ashraful captained his country in 13 Tests, and 38 One Day Internationals (ODIs) of which Bangladesh won eight. Ashraful has scored the fastest fifty in Test, ODI and Twenty20 international amongst all Bangladeshi cricketers.When not playing for the national team, Ashraful plays domestic cricket for the Dhaka Division cricket team in Bangladesh's domestic one-day and first-class competitions, captaining both sides on occasion. In 2014 the Bangladesh Cricket Board banned him for eight years after he was found guilty of match-fixing. The ban was later reduced to 5 years with 2 years suspended.After finishing suspension, Ashraful has been back & is playing in domestic cricket.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nAshraful made his first-class debut on 22 November 2000, playing for Dhaka Metropolis cricket team. He opened the batting, scoring 41 and 6; Ashraful also claimed five wickets for 59 runs in the first innings with his leg-spin bowling. Three days later Ashraful made his list A debut, again playing for Dhaka Metropolis and opening the batting he scored 22 and took two wickets as his team won the match. Ashraful scored his maiden first-class century in his second match, making 101 against Khulna cricket team. The seven wickets Ashraful took for 99 runs in a match against Chittagong Division in January 2001 remain his best bowling figures. Over the course of the season he played ten first-class matches \u2013 scoring 585 runs at an average of 30.78, including two centuries, and taking 39 wickets at an average of 25.48, including three five-wicket hauls. He also played nine list A matches, scoring 85 runs and taking four wickets.In November 2006, he set a league record score of 263, against Chittagong Division for Bangladeshi first-class cricket \u2013 although this record has since been bettered by Raqibul Hasan.Sonargaon Cricketers, a new team in the Dhaka Premier League for the 2005/06 season, signed Ashraful and Mohammad Rafique. The team lost four of its first five games and sought a change of leadership in an attempt to improve its results. He played for Rainhill CC in a local cricket league in England.On 6 February 2009, Ashraful took part in a player auction for the 2009 Indian Premier League. The Mumbai Indians bought him for his base price of US$75,000, but he only played one game and scored just 2 runs.He returned to domestic cricket in 2011, scoring a century for Dhaka Division in the opening match of the National Cricket League. Dhaka won the one-day competition, and Ashraful, who was the second-highest run-getter with 331 runs and claimed 7 wickets from 7 matches, was named player of the tournament.For the 2011/12 season, the National Cricket League of Bangladesh was expanded from six first-class teams to eight. Dhaka Metropolis and Rangpur Division were the new teams, with Ashraful captaining the former. Though he scored his first first-class century in over a year in the competition, Ashraful was dropped from the ODI squad to face Pakistan in December.During a match in the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League in January 2012, Ashraful was involved in an incident with Tamim Iqbal that led to the latter being banned for one match and fined. The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Ashraful the 'icon player' for Dhaka Gladiators. Dhaka won the tournament, and in twelve matches Ashraful scored 258 runs, making him the BPL's second highest run-scorer amongst Bangladesh batsmen.He was the leading run-scorer for Kala Bagan Krira Chakra in the 2017\u201318 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, with 665 runs in 13 matches.\nHe will play for Minister Group Rajshahi in Bangabandhu T20 cup.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Debut ===\nAshraful made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe on 11 April 2001, where he made 9 runs and Bangladesh lost the match by 36 runs. He took his first international wicket in the match, that of Andy Flower.\n\nAshraful made his Test debut on 6 September 2001 against Sri Lanka. He top-scored in each innings, and although Bangladesh slumped to an innings defeat, Ashraful scored 114, becoming the youngest player to score a Test century, beating Mushtaq Mohammad's record, and was named man of the match. He was the second Bangladesh player to score a Test century on debut, after Aminul Islam Bulbul in 2000 during Bangladesh's first Test. Trevor Chappell, a former coach of Bangladesh's national side, commented that \"His determination, commitment and attention to detail would put a mature and an established person to shame. The manner he concentrates on his batting made me believe that the lad is destined to have a long cricketing journey.\" Following Ashraful's debut century, however, a prolonged string of poor performances resulted in him being dropped from the national team.\n\n\n=== Patchy form ===\nHe had a poor first World Cup \u2013 the 2003 Cricket World Cup \u2013 making 71 runs at an average of 14.20, with Bangladesh being eliminated in the Group Stage.\nIn February and March 2004, Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe. At the time, Zimbabwe were without many of their senior players, but still won the Test series 1\u20130 and the ODI series 2\u20131. The solitary ODI victory was Bangladesh's first international win since defeating Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup; Ashraful scored 51 runs from 32 balls in the match and was named man of the match. Ashraful returned to the team in December 2004 against the Indian cricket team and scored his second century, 158 not out, claiming the record for the highest individual Test score by a Bangladeshi. India's captain, Sourav Ganguly, described the innings as one of the best Test innings he had seen.In May and June 2005, Bangladesh toured England for a two-Test series against the hosts and a triangular ODI tournament with England and Australia. Although they won just one ODI out of six, their solitary victory against Australia was described by Wisden as \"the biggest upset in one-day international history\". Ashraful scored 100 to help his side to victory and was named Man of the Match. He scored two more half-centuries in the series, finishing with 259 runs at an average of 43.16, making him third-highest run scorer in the series.\n\n\n=== Form continues ===\nIn 2006 he scored his third century, with 136 in the first test against Sri Lanka. Ashraful was selected for the Asian squad in the inaugural Afro-Asia Cup. With bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, he was one of two Bangladeshi players in the 15-man squad. Ashraful played in two of the matches, but failed to score a run.\n\nAshraful was appointed captain at a time when the club was facing relegation. Under his leadership, Sonargaon finished second in the league. The opening match of the two-Test series against Sri Lanka in February and March 2006 was played at Chittagong Divisional Stadium, the first international match the ground hosted. He scored 136 in the first innings, bringing up his third Test century; he received the man of the match award, although Sri Lanka won by eight wickets. Bangladesh lost the second Test by ten wickets and the series 2 0, with Ashraful managing 37 runs in the match and claimed the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene.The West Indies hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup in March and April; Ashraful was included in the 15-man squad led by Habibul Bashar. Bangladesh made it to the second stage of the competition and finished seventh. Along the way the team caused an upset by India to help knock them out of the tournament. Ashraful scored 87 runs from 83 balls against South Africa in the course of Bangladesh's 67-run victory. His innings was the highest score by a Bangladesh player in World Cups and he was named man of the match for the performance. With 216 runs from 9 matches at an average of 36, Ashraful was Bangladesh's highest run-scorer in the tournament.\n\n\n=== Captaincy (2007\u20132009) ===\nShortly after the World Cup, India toured Bangladesh for two Test matches and three ODIs. In the second Test, which Bangladesh lost by an innings and 239 runs, Ashraful scored the fastest half-century in Test cricket in terms of time (taking 27 minutes) and equal second-fastest when measured in balls faced (scored off 26 balls). Aside from the 67 he managed in one of the fastest half-centuries in Test cricket, Ashraful managed just five more runs in the series; in two ODIs, he scored 41 runs. After defeats in both series, Habibul Bashar stepped down from Bangladesh's one day captaincy; Mohammad Ashraful was appointed the team captain in all forms of cricket on 2 June 2007. At the time, he had played 35 Test and 101 ODIs and had some experience of captaincy at domestic level. Aged 22, he was the second-youngest international captainAshraful and Mortaza took on these roles from the start of the Sri Lanka tour in June 2007. Whatmore had declined to extend his contract and Shaun Williams took over as coach on a temporary basis. Bangladesh lost all three Tests by an innings; in a series in which his teams batsmen struggled \u2013 in the second Test they registered their lowest scored in an innings (62) \u2013 Ashraful scored the most runs for Bangladesh with 218 at an average of 43. In the second Test Ashraful combined with wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim to score 191 for the sixth wicket, establishing a record for Bangladesh, and Ashraful scored 129 not out. Bangladesh also lost the three-match ODI series that followed 3\u20130. In September 2007 South Africa hosted the ICC World Twenty20. Victory against West Indies in the first round was enough to ensure Bangladesh's progression to the second round, although it was the only one of their five matches they won. In the match against West Indies, Ashraful scored a record-breaking half-century, coming off just 20 deliveries it was at the time the fastest T20I half-century in terms of balls faced; he held onto the record for six days before Yuvraj Singh claimed it in a match against England (his 50 took just 12 balls).During the first Test match of South Africa's 2007\u201308 tour, Ashraful dismissed AB de Villiers in very unusual fashion: after the ball left his hand it bounced twice, at which point de Villiers attempted to hit the ball but instead sent it straight up instead. Ashraful caught the ball and, despite de Villiers standing his ground, umpire Steve Bucknor confirmed the dismissal. The dismissal was legal per Law 24, section 6 of the Laws of cricket which state the ball must bounce more than twice or roll along the ground to be deemed a no-ball.After an extended run of poor form and Bangladesh's first-round exit in the World Twenty20 2009, Ashraful was sacked as captain in June 2009. He was replaced by Mashrafe Mortaza for the tour of West Indies, with Shakib Al Hasan taking the position of vice-captain. It was hoped that Ashraful could climb out of the batting form slump in all formats in the international game with the release of the pressure of the captaincy.However, Ashraful captained Bangladesh at the 2010 Asian Games in late November. They played Afghanistan in the final; Bangladesh won by five wickets, securing the country's first gold medal at the Asian Games.\n\n\n=== Post-captaincy (2009\u2013present) ===\n\nAshraful was dropped when England toured Bangladesh in February and March 2010. He was recalled for Bangladesh's tour of England two months later. He struggled in June's 2010 Asia Cup, and was subsequently dropped; he was recalled for the ODI leg of the England tour due to injuries to the squad. After a poor run of form, Ashraful was dropped for ODI series against New Zealand in October 2010. Though he was out of the squad, the following month when the BCB announced its central contracts for the coming year Ashraful was one of six players given the highest level of contract (A+).The West Indies toured in October, but after scoring just two runs in as many matches in the ODI series against them, Ashraful was dropped from the Test squad.Shortly after winning the Asian Games, Ashraful was recalled to Bangladesh's full squad for the five-match ODI series against Zimbabwe in December. Though they lost the first match, Bangladesh went on to win the next three completed, with one called off due to rain, to beat Zimbabwe 3\u20131. Ashraful played one match, scoring six runs.He was included in Bangladesh's 15-man squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, co-hosted by Bangladesh along with India and Sri Lanka. From three matches Ashraful managed 18 runs and was dropped out from the squad for the three-match ODI series against Australia that followed.\n\n\n=== In and Out from team ===\nIn April he captained Bangladesh A on a tour of South Africa and his performances, including striking a one-day century, earned him a recall to the senior squad to face Zimbabwe in August. In the one-off Test, Ashraful scored the most runs for his team with an aggregate of 112, including a half-century as Bangladesh succumbed to defeat. Bangladesh lost the following ODI series against Zimbabwe 3\u20132. Bangladesh's batsmen struggled early in the series, and Ashraful scored 23 runs from three matches.He was retained in the Test side for the Pakistan series in 2012, but was dropped after the first Test, in which he scored only one run. When the BCB announced its central contracts for 2012, Ashraful's A+ contract was not renewed.\n\nIn October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Chittagong Vikings team, following the draft for the 2018\u201319 Bangladesh Premier League. During Corona,He has worked on his fitness.He is trying his best to come back in the national team of Bangladesh for at least 1 match.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAshraful created some controversy in March 2008 when he slapped a fan who called him \"rubbish\" while he was training at an indoor stadium in Dhaka. This happened at a time when Ashraful was being heavily criticised in the media for his poor form with the bat and questionable tactics on the field as captain. The BCB fined him 25% of his salary for the month of March 2008 for violating the Code of Conduct. He later apologised for the incident.\n\n\n=== Spot-fixing controversy ===\nMohammad Ashraful admitted to spot-fixing during the 2013 Bangladesh Premier League. The Bangladesh Cricket Board reacted immediately by suspending him from all forms of the game temporarily, until the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit submits its report on investigations into fixing. The alleged fixing involves a match between the Dhaka Gladiators and the Chittagong Vikings in 2013 teams during the second edition of the BPL on 2 February 2013. The 28-year-old Ashraful was allegedly paid about $12,800 to lose the match, but the cheque he was given later bounced, according to the local media. He was also allegedly involved in fixing another match 10 days later, against the Barisal Burners, which his team lost by seven wickets. In June 2014, the Bangladesh Cricket Board found him guilty and banned him for eight years but reduced to five years (with two years suspended) later on.In August 2016 Ashraful's ban was partially lifted, allowing him to play in domestic cricket in Bangladesh. He became eligible to play in international fixtures in 2018.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammad Ashraful at ESPNcricinfo\nMohammad Ashraful's Profile on BanglaCricket\nAshraful's battle to make his mark by S.Rajesh"

He is a specialist batsman who has batted between five and eight in the batting order for Hong Kong, scoring 15 ICC Trophy runs and 24 One Day International runs. In his debut match in the ICC Trophy, he was the seventh-choice bowler for Hong Kong, bowling the final over against Canada. However, he first bowled two wides (one of which was run for three), and then got injured. Because of the runs off wides counting against the bowler, but the wide not counting as a ball bowled, Lamsam ended with no balls bowled - and four runs conceded. As that was his only bowling in the ICC Trophy, this is still his career record.\nLamsam was selected to play for Hong Kong in the 2004 Asia Cup, scoring eight runs and taking zero wickets against Bangladesh.  He played a second ODI against India at the 2008 Asia Cup, scoring 16 before being run out by MS Dhoni.\n\n\n== References ==\nRoy Lamsam at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Andrew James Hall (born 31 July 1975) is a former South African first-class cricketer who played from 1999 until 2011. He played as an all-rounder who bowled fast-medium pace and has been used as both an opening batsman and in the lower order. He was born in Johannesburg in South Africa in 1975 and educated at Ho\u00ebrskool Alberton in Alberton, Gauteng.\nPrior to making it on the South African first-class cricket scene he played indoor cricket for South Africa. He broke through in 1995/96 and has played for Transvaal, Gauteng, and Easterns.\nInternationally, Hall was initially thought of solely as a limited overs cricket specialist and made his ODI debut against the West Indies at Durban in 1999. He was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa's 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He appeared in the Test side sporadically and made his debut in 2002 against Australia at Cape Town. Batting at number 8, he scored 70 but did not pick up any wickets in the match.He retired from international cricket in September 2007 but continued to play domestic cricket in both South Africa and England until 2014.\n\n\n== International career ==\nDuring the 2003 England tour he received a late call-up to the South African squad and impressed with 16 wickets in the Test series. He scored a match-winning 99 not out at Headingley and became the 5th batsman in Test cricket to have been stranded one short of a hundred.In 2004, due to the absence of the recently retired Gary Kirsten and non-touring Herschelle Gibbs, he was promoted to open the batting in the Test series against India. He reacted to the added responsibility by scoring 163 at Kanpur - his maiden Test century. The century was made against the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, batting for almost ten hours.He holds the World Record 8th wicket stand in ODI cricket of 138 with Justin Kemp, made against India in November 2006. His contribution was an unbeaten 56 from 47 balls and he went on to take 3 wickets in the second innings.During the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies he took his maiden 5 wicket haul (5/18) against England on 17 April at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados.\n\n\n=== International retirement ===\nHall retired from international cricket in September 2007. Whilst not giving a reason for his decision, Graham Ford - Hall's coach at Kent - speculated it was due to his omission from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship squad, saying:\nI can only assume that he was reacting to the bitter disappointment of being left out of the World Cup [Championship] squad.\n\n\n== County career ==\nHall played for Durham Cricket Board in the 1999 NatWest Trophy, his first experience in English County Cricket. He played one List A match for Suffolk in the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy whilst playing for Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League. This was Halls only appearance in any form of cricket for Suffolk. He then played his first senior English cricket for Worcestershire in the 2003 and 2004 English seasons.\nHall moved to play for Kent from 2005 to 2007, playing parts of each season when not appearing for the South African side. He returned to England in 2008 when he signed for Northamptonshire as a Kolpak player. While playing for Northants he set a record for the side's best Twenty20 bowling figures, taking 6/21 against Worcestershire in 2008. He also achieved his best Twenty20 batting performance in the same game (66 not out). He became captain of the county in 2010 after fellow South African Nicky Boje resigned, remaining captain until after the 2012 season when he was replaced by Stephen Peters. During his tenure as captain he nearly led Northants to promotion in the County Championship.\nHall continued to play for Northants until the end of the 2014 season when he was not offered a new contract. He announced his retirement from professional cricket shortly afterwards.\n\n\n== Mugging incidents ==\nHall was the victim of a robbery at an automatic teller machine in 1999 during which he was shot in his left hand. The mugger is said to have fired six shots at him. In 2002, he was driven around in his own car with a gun pointed to his head.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAndrew Hall at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Sir Charles Aubrey Smith, CBE (21 July 1863 \u2013 20 December 1948) was an English Test cricketer who became a stage and film actor, acquiring a niche as the officer-and-gentleman type, as in the first sound version of The Prisoner of Zenda (1937). In Hollywood, he organised British actors into a cricket team, much intriguing local spectators.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSmith was born in London, England, to Charles John Smith (1838\u20131928), a medical doctor, and Sarah Ann (n\u00e9e Clode, 1836\u20131922). His sister, Beryl Faber (died 1912), was married to Cosmo Hamilton.\nSmith was educated at Charterhouse School and St John's College, Cambridge. He settled in South Africa to prospect for gold in 1888\u201389. While there he developed pneumonia and was wrongly pronounced dead by doctors. He married Isabella Wood in 1896.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nAs a cricketer, Smith was primarily a right arm fast bowler, though he was also a useful right-hand lower-order batsman and a good slip fielder. His oddly curved bowling run-up, which started from deep mid-off, earned him the nickname \"Round the Corner Smith\". When he bowled round the wicket his approach was concealed from the batsman by the umpire until he emerged, leading W. G. Grace to comment \"it is rather startling when he suddenly appears at the bowling crease.\" He played for Cambridge University (1882\u201385) and for Sussex at various times from 1882 to 1892. While in South Africa he captained the Johannesburg English XI. He captained England to victory in his only Test match, against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1888\u201389, taking five wickets for nineteen runs in the first innings. The English team who played were by no means representative of the best players of the time and nobody at the time realised that the match would enter the cricket records as an official Test match.His home club for much of his career was West Drayton Cricket club. Actors would arrive from London to the purpose built train station in West Drayton and taken by horse drawn carriage to the ground.\u2014\nIn 1932, he founded the Hollywood Cricket Club and created a pitch with imported English grass. He attracted fellow expatriates such as David Niven, Laurence Olivier, Nigel Bruce (who served as captain), Leslie Howard and Boris Karloff to the club as well as local American players. Smith's stereotypical Englishness spawned several amusing anecdotes: while fielding at slip for the Hollywood Club, he dropped a difficult catch and ordered his English butler to fetch his spectacles; they were brought on to the field on a silver platter. The next ball looped gently to slip, to present the kind of catch that \"a child would take at midnight with no moon.\" Smith dropped it and, snatching off his lenses, commented, \"Damned fool brought my reading glasses.\" Decades after his cricket career had ended, when he had long been a famous face in films, Smith was spotted in the pavilion on a visit to Lord's. \"That man over there seems familiar\", remarked one member to another. \"Yes\", said the second, seemingly oblivious to his Hollywood fame, \"Chap called Smith. Used to play for Sussex.\"\n\n\n== Acting career ==\n\nSmith began acting on the London stage in 1895. His first major role was in Prisoner of Zenda the following year, playing the dual lead roles of king and look-alike. Forty-one years later, he appeared in the most acclaimed film version of the novel, this time as the wise old adviser. When Raymond Massey asked him to help him understand the role of Black Michael, he answered \"My dear Ray, in my time I have played every part in The Prisoner of Zenda except Princess Flavia. And I always had trouble with Black Michael!\" He made his Broadway debut as early as 1895 in The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith. In 1907 he appeared with Marie Doro in The Morals of Marcus, a play Doro later made into a silent film. Smith later appeared in a revival of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion in the starring role of Henry Higgins.\nSmith appeared in early films for the nascent British film industry, starring in The Bump in 1920 (written by A. A. Milne for the company Minerva Films, which was founded in 1920 by the actor Leslie Howard and his friend and story editor Adrian Brunel).  Smith later went to Hollywood where he had a successful career as a character actor playing either officer or gentleman roles. One role in 1937 was as Colonel Williams in Wee Willie Winkie, starring Shirley Temple, Victor McLaglen, Cesar Romero and June Lang. He was regarded as being the unofficial leader of the British film industry colony in Hollywood, which Sheridan Morley characterised as the Hollywood Raj, a select group of British actors who were seen to be colonising the capital of the film business in the 1930s. Other film stars considered to be \"members\" of this select group were David Niven (whom Smith treated like a son), Ronald Colman, Rex Harrison, Robert Coote, Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce (whose daughter's wedding he had attended as best man), Leslie Howard (whom Smith had known since working with him on early films in London), and Patric Knowles.\nSmith expected his fellow countrymen to report for regular duty at his Hollywood Cricket Club. Anyone who refused was known to \"incur his displeasure\". Fiercely patriotic, Smith became openly critical of the British actors of enlistment age who did not return to fight after the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Smith loved playing on his status as Hollywood's \"Englishman in Residence\". His bushy eyebrows, beady eyes, handlebar moustache, and height of 6'2\" made him one of the most recognisable faces in Hollywood.\nSmith starred alongside leading ladies such as Greta Garbo, Elizabeth Taylor, and Vivien Leigh as well as the actors Clark Gable, Laurence Olivier, Ronald Colman, Maurice Chevalier, and Gary Cooper. His films include The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), The Four Feathers (1939), Hitchcock's  Rebecca (1940), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941), And Then There Were None (1945) in which he played General Mandrake, and the 1949 remake of Little Women starring Elizabeth Taylor and Janet Leigh, in which he portrayed the aged grandfather of Laurie Lawrence (played by a young Peter Lawford), who generously gives a piano to the frail Beth March (played by Margaret O'Brien). He also appeared as the father of Maureen O'Sullivan in Tarzan the Ape Man, the first Tarzan film with Johnny Weissm\u00fcller. Smith also played a leading role as the Earl of Dorincourt in David O. Selznick's adaption Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936).\nHe appeared in Dennis Wheatley's 1934 thriller Such Power Is Dangerous, about an attempt to take over Hollywood, under the fictitious name of Warren Hastings Rook (rather than Charles Aubrey Smith). Author Evelyn Waugh leaned heavily on Smith in drawing the character of Sir Ambrose Abercrombie for Waugh's 1948 satire of Hollywood The Loved One. Commander McBragg in the TV cartoon Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales is a parody of him.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSmith died from pneumonia at home in Beverly Hills on 20 December 1948, aged 85. He was survived by his wife and their daughter, Honor. His body was cremated and nine months later, in accordance with his instructions, the ashes were returned to England and interred in his mother's grave at St Leonard's churchyard in Hove, Sussex.\n\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nSmith has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Smith was an officer in the Legion of Frontiersmen.\nIn 1933, he was on the first board of the Screen Actors Guild.\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1938 and was knighted by King George VI in 1944 for services to Anglo-American amity.\n\n\n== Complete filmography ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistory of Test cricket (1884 to 1889)\nList of England cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavid Rayvern Allen, Sir Aubrey: Biography of C.

        "article": "Rupert Psmith (or Ronald Eustace Psmith, as he is called in the last of the four books in which he appears) is a recurring fictional character in several novels by British author P. G. Wodehouse, being one of Wodehouse's best-loved characters.\nThe P in his surname is silent (\"as in pshrimp\", in his own words) and was added by himself, in order to distinguish him from other Smiths. A member of the Drones Club, this monocle-sporting Old Etonian is something of a dandy, a fluent and witty speaker, and has a remarkable ability to pass through the most amazing adventures unruffled.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nWodehouse said that he based Psmith on Rupert D'Oyly Carte (1876\u20131948), the son of the Gilbert and Sullivan impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, as he put it \"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Carte was a school acquaintance of a cousin of Wodehouse at Winchester College, according to an introduction to Leave It to Psmith. Rupert's daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte, however, believed that the Wykehamist schoolboy described to Wodehouse was not her father but his elder brother Lucas, who was also at Winchester.\n\n\n== Appearances and names ==\nPsmith appears in four novel-length works, all of which appeared as magazine serials before being published in book form.\n\nAll these works also feature Mike Jackson, Psmith's solid, cricket-playing friend and sidekick, the original hero and central character of Mike and Psmith in the City, until eclipsed by Psmith's wit and force of personality.\nIn his first appearance (in Mike, Enter Psmith or Mike and Psmith, depending on edition) Psmith introduces himself as Rupert. He is also referred to as Rupert twice in Psmith in the City.\nIn Leave it to Psmith, however, he introduces himself as Ronald Eustace. This is perhaps because Leave it to Psmith contains another character named Rupert, the efficient Baxter; Wodehouse presumably thought having two Ruperts would be confusing for readers, and since Psmith is generally referred to by his surname only, it was not unreasonable for Wodehouse to assume that the change would go largely unnoticed.\nIn the United States version of The Prince and Betty, essentially a reworking of Psmith, Journalist, relocated to New York City and merged with some elements of the United Kingdom version The Prince and Betty, the Psmith character is replaced with one Rupert Smith, an American and alumnus of Harvard, who retains many of Psmith's characteristics, including the monocle. A Prince for Hire is another blending of these stories.\nLeave It to Psmith differs somewhat in style from its predecessors. While Mike is a school story along the lines of much of Wodehouse's early output, and Psmith in the City and Psmith, Journalist are youthful adventures, Psmith's final appearance fits the pattern of Wodehouse's more mature period, a romantic comedy set in the idyllic, invariably imposter-ridden Blandings Castle, where Psmith fulfils the role of ingenious, unflappable fixer, a part taken elsewhere by the likes of Gally, Uncle Fred, or indeed the mighty Jeeves, and finally shows a romantic streak of his own. Though predating both Jeeves and Uncle Fred by some years, Psmith seems to be a combination of both characters, on the one hand imbued with Jeeves' precision of speech and concern for being well turned out, and on the other hand replete with Uncle Fred's humorous self-expression and insouciant attitude, in which Jeeves would never indulge.\n\n\n== Life and character ==\nWe first meet Psmith shortly after he has been expelled from Eton, and sent to Sedleigh, where he meets Mike, and their long friendship begins. As tall and thin a boy as he will later be a man, he is even then immaculately dressed, and sports his trademark monocle; his speech is fluid and flowery.\nThe Psmith name, he admits from the start, is one he has adopted that morning, as there are \"too many Smiths\u201d. His father, Mr Smith, is a fairly wealthy man, although a little eccentric, who lives at Corfby Hall, Lower Benford, in Shropshire, not far from Crofton where his friend Mike grew up; he later moves to Ilsworth Hall, in a \"neighbouring county\", mostly to find better cricket.\nNot the most active of youths, Psmith spends much of his time at Sedleigh lounging in deck chairs. His most notable talent, even at this age, is a remarkable verbal dexterity, which he uses to confound and confuse boys and masters alike; with his sombre, still face, it is often impossible to tell if he is being serious or mocking. This skill frequently comes in handy, to get himself and his friends out of difficulty. In such circumstances, he is even known to move fairly quickly too.\nWhile at Eton, he was a competent cricketer, on the verge of the first team - a slow left-arm bowler with a swerve, his enormous reach also makes him handy with a bat when some fast hitting is required, such as in the match between Sedleigh and Wrykyn at the climax of Mike and Psmith.\nAfter Sedleigh, Psmith goes to work at the New Asiatic Bank, having annoyed his father's schoolfriend John Bickersdyke. After a time there, he persuades his father he should study to become a lawyer, and goes to Cambridge, accompanied as ever by his friend and companion Mike.\nDuring the summer after their first year, Psmith travels to New York, accompanying Mike, who is on a cricketing tour with the M.C.C. There, he gets involved with the magazine Cosy Moments, befriending its temporary editor Billy Windsor and helping in its crusade against slum housing, which involves clashes with violent gangsters. We discover in the last chapter, when the head editor returns, that Psmith has persuaded his father to let him invest some money he has inherited from an uncle and now, in fact, owns the magazine.\nAfter university, his father dies, having made some unsound investments. As a result, Psmith must work for a time for an uncle in the fish business, something which repels him. He leaves the job shortly before meeting and falling for Eve Halliday, whom he follows to Blandings Castle. Despite having entered the castle claiming to be Canadian poet Ralston McTodd, he is eventually hired as secretary to Lord Emsworth, who knew his father by reputation, and is engaged to Eve Halliday. \nIn a preface to the 1953 version of Mike and Psmith, Wodehouse informs us that Psmith went on to become a successful defence lawyer, in the style of Perry Mason. In his introduction to the omnibus The World of Psmith (1974), Wodehouse suggests that Psmith eventually became a judge.Psmith is a principled young man and is generous towards those he likes. In a typical example from Leave it to Psmith, he perceives Eve, trapped by the rain under an awning, and decides, as a chivalrous gentleman, to get her an umbrella, which he unfortunately does not possess. He solves this problem by appropriating one, and when confronted by the owner, Psmith attempts to mollify him by saying it is for a good cause; and he later recounts it as: \"Merely practical Socialism. Other people are content to talk about the Redistribution of Property. I go out and do it.\" (Another of Psmith's quirks is his penchant for nominal socialism, observed mostly in his casual use of \"Comrade\" as a substitute for \"Mister.\")\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nIn the 1930 play Leave It to Psmith adapted from the novel by Wodehouse and Ian Hay, Psmith was portrayed by Basil Foster, with Jane Baxter as Eve Halliday. The 1933 film based on the play, Leave It to Me, replaced Psmith with a different character, Sebastian Help, who was portrayed by Gene Gerrard, with Molly Lamont as Eve Halliday.Simon Ward voiced Psmith, with Caroline Langrishe as Eve Halliday, in the radio adaptation of Leave it to Psmith dramatised by Michael Bakewell, which aired on BBC Radio 4 on 3 October 1981.Psmith was portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis in the BBC television film Thank You, P. G. Wodehouse. The film aired on 16 October 1981.In the BBC radio adaptation of Psmith in the City dramatised by Marcy Kahan, which first aired in four parts in 2008, Nick Caldecott voiced Psmith, with Inam Mirza as Mike Jackson.Edward Bennett played Psmith in the 2020 BBC radio dramatisation of Leave it to Psmith, with Susannah Fielding as Eve and Ifan Meredith as Mike Jackson.\n\n\n== See also ==\nA list of characters involved in Psmith's adventures\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nBibliographyTaves, Brian (2006).

        "article": "Sandeep Madhusudan Patil (Marathi: \u0938\u0902\u0926\u0940\u092a \u092e\u0927\u0941\u0938\u0941\u0926\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0940\u0932; pronunciation ; born 18 August 1956) is a former Indian cricketer, Indian national age group cricket manager and former Kenya national team coach, who guided the minnows to the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup. He was a hard-hitting middle order batsman and an occasional medium pace bowler. He was the coach of Mumbai Champs in the Indian Cricket League, but returned to the mainstream when he cut ties with the unofficial league in 2009. He has been appointed as the director of National Cricket Academy (NCA) by the BCCI, replacing Dav Whatmore. He was appointed as the new chief of the BCCI Selection Committee on 27 September 2012.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSandeep Patil was born on 8 August 1956 in Mumbai. His father, Madhusudan Patil, was a former first class cricketer, national level badminton player and skilled player of tennis and football. He grew up in the Shivaji Park area in Bombay, studied in Balmohan Vidyamandir and Ramnarain Ruia College and was coached by Ankush 'Anna' Vaidya.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nIn the early part of his career Patil was as much a medium pacer who bowled off the wrong foot, as he was a batsman. Following three successful years for the Bombay university in the Rohinton Baria Trophy, he made the Bombay Ranji team in 1975\u201376. After being on and off the team for three seasons, he played his first major innings against Delhi in the 1979 semifinal. Going in at No.6 after Bombay lost the first four wickets for 72, Patil hit 145 in 276 minutes with 18 fours and a six, none of his partners made more than 25. Patil played for Edmonton in the Middlesex league in 1979 and 1980, and for Somerset 'B' in the latter year.\nAustralia and Pakistan visited India in 1979\u201380. Patil appeared in tour matches for West Zone against both teams, scoring 44 and 23 against Australia, and 68 and 71 against Pakistan. This earned him the selection in the last two Test matches against Pakistan. A week before making the debut, he made his career best first class score against Saurashtra at the Wankhede Stadium. Coming in to bat in the second morning he was 45* at lunch, reached his hundred in 139 balls scoring 105 in the second session, and ended up with 210 made in 205 balls with seven sixes and nineteen fours. The last of the sixes cleared the stadium (a very rare feat at the Wankhede) and landed in the hockey grounds outside. Patil made 62 in the final Test at Calcutta, appeared in the Golden Jubilee Test against England later in the season and was selected for the tour of Australia in 1980\u201381.\nIn the early matches of the Australian tour, he scored 116 against South Australia, which included Rodney Hogg, and 60 and 97 against Queensland which had Jeff Thomson, Geoff Dymock and Carl Rackemann. He won the man of the match on his ODI debut for a 64 against Australia.In the first innings of the first Test at Sydney Patil had reached 65 when just before the tea break on the first day, he was hit on the throat by Hogg. Continuing without a helmet, he was hit over the right ear by a bouncer by Len Pascoe in the first over after tea. Patil collapsed in the crease and had to retire hurt. Though still unwell, he batted in the second innings at the insistence of captain Sunil Gavaskar as India struggled to avoid an innings defeat.Two weeks later, with a helmet on, Patil hit a spectacular 174 in the Adelaide Test. It came after India lost the first four wickets for 130 against the Australian total of 528. At the time the highest innings by an Indian in Australia, it took him just over five hours and included twenty two fours and a six over mid-wicket off Bruce Yardley. In the next series against New Zealand, Patil opened the bowling for India along with Kapil Dev in the Auckland Test.Patil found himself out of the team after four Tests in the home series against England in 1981\u201382 but was picked for the away series that followed immediately after. Here in the Manchester Test he scored his second hundred. India was in some danger of following on when he added 96 runs with Kapil Dev a little over an hour. England took the second new ball soon after and Patil hit the last two balls of an over from Ian Botham for four and three. In the next over he hit Bob Willis for six fours (4440444, the third ball being a no ball) \u2013 \"two cover drives, one flat batted back over the bowler's head, two square cuts of ferocious power and a mighty hook\" [1]- taking his score from 73 to 104 in nine balls. He was 129 not out when rain brought an early end to the match.Another hundred followed against Sri Lanka in September but he was again out the team by the middle of the season. While the Indian team toured West Indies, he scored 121* in 84 balls in the second innings of the Ranji final against Karnataka. All his runs came in single session on the final day as Bombay was targeting a declaration. Patil scored 216 runs in eight matches in the Prudential World Cup including 51* in the semifinal against England. He scored 609 runs in the 1983\u201384 Ranji season, and his fourth and last Test hundred against Pakistan at Faisalabad.\nOn the last day of the Delhi Test against England in December 1984, with his score on 41, Patil was caught at long on attempting a big hit off the bowling of Phil Edmonds. This triggered a collapse and India lost the match that could well have been saved. Patil was dropped in the next test at Kolkata as a disciplinary measure, along with Kapil Dev who also fell to a similar shot off the bowling of Pat Pocock. Mohammad Azharuddin who took his place scored hundreds in his first three Test matches and Patil played no more Test cricket, although Kapil Dev would return to squad. In 1986, he was recalled for a few more one day matches. He also toured England without appearing in Tests.\nPatil announced his retirement from first class cricket after appearing for Bombay against the Australians in September 1986. But he came back to captain the Madhya Pradesh cricket team from 1988 to 1993 with considerable success. One of the more notable innings was a 185 against Bombay in 1990. He went on to coach the Indian national team and the 'A' team. As the coach of Kenya, he guided them to an unlikely semifinal place in the 2003 World Cup.\nHe served as chairman of selectors of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from 27 September 2012 to September 2016.\n\n\n== Bollywood debut ==\nSoon after the 1983 Cricket World Cup victory, Patil was offered by Vijay Singh to play the male lead opposite two Bollywood actresses Poonam Dhillon and Debashree Roy in Kabhie Ajnabi The while Syed Kirmani was offered to essay the role of a strong antagonist. Reportedly Patil got so occupied with his Bollywood debut that he refused to participate in the West Indies tour in 1983. Though the cricketer later reasoned that he had opted out of that tour because he was nursing an injury at that time. The filming began in 1983 and the film was released in 1985. The film was highly publicised on the fighting sequence between Patil and Kirmani as well as his chemistry with Debashree Roy especially in the song sequence Geet Mere Hothon Ko Dey Gaya Koi. It opened with 80% seat occupancy but ultimately became a major debacle at box office.\n\nESPN wrote on his performance, \"he even aces the love-struck Hindi film hero's signature move of producing notes from a guitar without moving either hand\". Sportstar commented on his performance that he acted \"dashed awkward\" in the film. The Tribune wrote, \"In contrast to their heroics in the 1983 World Cup, Patil and Kirmani were clean bowled on the big screen\".\n\n\n== Editing career ==\nPatil edited Marathi sports magazine Ekach Shatkar which was, once a top selling sports magazine in Maharashtra. It outsold Sportstar and was often considered as the last nail in the coffin of Sportsweek. The largest selling newspaper Mahanagar was also started in his garage.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1983, Patil was married when he met Debashree Roy on the set of Kabhie Ajnabi The (1985) and reportedly had an affair with her. Indian media interpreted their affair as the sole reason for the failure of his first marriage. Reportedly, soon after the release of the film they discontinued their relationship and never publicly discussed anything on their separation. He later married Deepa. He has two sons, Chirag Patil and Prateek Patil. He wrote his autobiography Sandy Storm in 1984.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nChirag Patil will be seen portraying Patil in Kabir Khan's 83 (2020) which also stars Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSujit Mukherjee, Matched winners, Orient Longman (1996)\nSandeep Patil, Sandy Storm, Rupa & Co (1984)\n^ Benson & Hedges Cricket Year, 1981\u201382\n\n\n== External links ==\nSandeep Patil at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Dermot Alexander Reeve OBE (born 2 April 1963) is an English former cricketer, best known as an unorthodox all-rounder and captain and, most recently, coach of the New Zealand side, Central Districts.\nReeve played in three Tests and 29 One Day Internationals (ODI) for England. He played English county cricket for Sussex, Warwickshire and Somerset. He is a former Hong Kong sports personality of the year, gained for his cricketing efforts in that country.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nReeve was born in Hong Kong in 1963 to parents who were working in the territory as teachers. His mother, Monica, later served as a scorer for a number of England Test matches. He also played for KJS football team alongside captain of the team Steven Markbreiter, who now coaches the Hong Kong based team Sai Kung Bulldogs.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nReeve first played cricket in England as a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers \u2013 an academy of up and coming young players between the ages of 18 and 20, who are based at Lord's. He signed for Sussex in June of the 1983 English season, and took 42 wickets in the County Championship at 29.35 apiece. He was given little opportunity with the bat, batting at number 10, but performed the duties of night watchman. This helped Reeve show his batting ability when, as night watchman, he made his maiden first class hundred against Surrey at Guildford. He remained with Sussex for six seasons, his most successful being 1987 when he managed a batting average of over 40, and took 42 wickets at under 30.\nHis lack of a high enough batting position at Sussex led to his move to Warwickshire in 1988, and it was here that he gained his greatest successes. In the batsman-friendly summer of 1990 his average was 54 runs. He also made his highest first-class score of 202 not out (against an attack including Curtly Ambrose), and two other centuries on the way to a total of 1,412 runs. He averaged over 40 runs for Warwickshire during his time at the Midlands club proving the move a good decision and helping him gain international selection.\nReeve was made captain in 1993, and in 1994 led the county to an unprecedented domestic treble; winning the County Championship, the AXA Equity and Law League, and the Benson & Hedges Cup - though they were defeated in the final of the NatWest Trophy. This achievement came alongside well-publicised differences of opinion with Warwickshire's star batsman, Brian Lara, vividly described a few years later by Reeve in his book Winning Ways. He was known for his inventive cricket brain and once held the bat left handed and swept Ravi Shastri against Glamorgan - today known as the switch hit.\nOne of his improvisations against left-arm spinner, Rajesh Maru, of Hampshire was to drop his bat to avoid being caught out by the close fielders.Warwickshire retained their Championship and NatWest Trophy crowns the following season, but Reeve left Warwickshire halfway through the 1996 season. Reeve made over \u00a3400,000 tax free during his benefit year with Warwickshire. Reeve was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1996, and received the OBE for services to cricket that same year. He moved on to become coach to Somerset (for whom he also played several games in one-day cricket in 1998), and also began to work as a cricket commentator for Channel 4 Television.\n\n\n== International cricket ==\nReeve played for Hong Kong at the 1982 ICC Trophy, averaging 34.50 with the bat and 15.71 with the ball. He returned to international cricket in 1991, playing for England. Reeve played only three Test matches for England, but his improvising style was better suited to One Day Internationals and he made 29 appearances in this form of the game, appearing in both the 1992 and 1996 World Cups. However, he never scored highly in ODIs, and his batting average would have been considerably lower, but for his high proportion of not-out innings.\n\n\n== TV commentator and controversy ==\nFollowing his retirement from cricket, Reeve was involved with the Channel 4 broadcasting coverage of cricket from the start when the channel won the rights from the BBC to show England Tests in the UK. Duties included fronting the studio discussions with pundits, commentary, introducing and presenting awards after televised matches, and interviewing both present and past players. In May 2005, Reeve admitted that he had an addiction to cocaine, and had used the drug prior to commentating on the 2004 first Test between England and New Zealand at Lord's. Reeve duly quit Channel Four after working for five years as part of their commentary team. He also admitted to using marijuana whilst he was an active player for Warwickshire but only out of season.In more recent years, Reeve has worked as a commentator on the BBC radio show Test Match Special. He also commentated on the Indian Premier League (IPL) English-language television coverage.Following his cocaine revelations in 2005, Reeve's family built a new life in Australia and New Zealand. Their assets included a $3 million waterfront mansion at Clontarf.\nFurther scandal was to follow Reeve at the end of 2009, when he was exposed as a seller of Donald Bradman \"signatures\" on plain card which were later confirmed by the Bradman Museum to be poor copies of the legendary player's signature.\n\n\n== New Zealand ==\nReeve relocated with his family to New Zealand in 2006, and was named as coach of the Central Districts States Team in July 2008. Despite leading the side to the Plunket Shield four-day final in 2008\u201309, before winning the 2009\u201310 Twenty20 competition, his tenure as coach was at times controversial - one particular incident seeing him fined and censured for accusing England international Ravi Bopara of ball-tampering during a domestic one-day match. On 7 April 2010, he ended his stint as coach of the Stags by mutual consent to spend time with his family, now living in Sydney, Australia.\n\n\n== Indian Premier League ==\nHe served as an assistant coach for the Pune Warriors India in the 2011 Indian Premier League.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Test cricketers born in non-Test playing nations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDermot Reeve at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "The Fifth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Peter Davison.Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.\nDavison portrays the Fifth Doctor as having a vulnerable side and a tendency towards indecisiveness, dressed as a boyish Edwardian cricketer. He travelled with a host of companions, including boy genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), alien aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton) and Australian flight attendant Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding), whom he had travelled alongside in his previous incarnation. He also shared later adventures alongside devious schoolboy Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) and American college student Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant).\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAfter Tom Baker, the Fourth Doctor, and the BBC had announced that he was leaving the role, the show's producers decided that the next Doctor was to be played by someone who presented something of a physical contrast to Baker and by an actor who was already firmly established in the British public's mind. Peter Davison was chosen due to his critically acclaimed role as Tristan Farnon in the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small which had Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner as line producer.The Fifth Doctor's era was notable for a \"back to the basics\" attitude, in which \"silly\" humour (and, to an extent, horror) was kept to a minimum, and more scientific accuracy was encouraged by the producer, John Nathan-Turner. It was, at times, a darker and grittier series, in part for seeing the death of one of his companions, Adric. It was also notable for the reintroduction of many of the Time Lord's enemies, such as the Master, Cybermen, Omega, the Black and White Guardians, and the Silurians.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe Fourth Doctor was seriously injured after falling off the Pharos Project Radio Telescope so he merged with a future incarnation of himself called the Watcher and regenerated into his new youthful fifth incarnation. The regeneration was difficult, and nearly failed, with the Doctor briefly taking on personality aspects from his four previous incarnations. After recovering in the fictional city Castrovalva (actually an elaborate trap created by his arch-enemy the Master), he continued his travels with Adric, Tegan Jovanka and Nyssa. Initially his travels centred on getting Tegan back to Heathrow Airport in time for her first day as an airhostess, but the TARDIS repeatedly missed this destination and Tegan eventually decided to stay in the TARDIS. After trips to the future and the past encountering villains such as Monarch and the Mara, the Fifth Doctor was confronted with tragedy when Adric died trying to stop a space freighter from crashing into prehistoric Earth (Earthshock).Following Adric's death, the TARDIS accidentally arrived at Heathrow airport (Time-Flight). Here the Doctor and Nyssa left Tegan assuming she would want to stay (when in fact she did not any more). The Doctor and Nyssa then travelled together for an unspecified amount of time before the renegade Time Lord Omega, attempting to return to our universe, temporally bonded himself to the Doctor (Arc of Infinity). Faced with this threat, the Time Lords were forced to attempt executing the Doctor, but he eventually tracked Omega to Amsterdam where he defeated him and re-encountered Tegan (who having now lost her job, had no second thoughts about rejoining the TARDIS crew).\nWhen the Doctor met a new companion, an alien boy stranded on Earth by the name of Vislor Turlough, he did not know that Turlough had been commissioned by the Black Guardian to kill him. Soon after, Nyssa left to help cure Lazar's Disease on the space station Terminus. After meeting the entities known as Eternals racing in yacht-like spacecraft for the prize of \"Enlightenment\", Turlough broke free from the Black Guardian's influence, and continued to travel with the Doctor and Tegan. Landing in the reign of King John (\"The King's Demons\"), the crew again encountered the Master, who was using a shape-shifting robot Kamelion to impersonate the King. However, the Doctor helped Kamelion to regain his free will and the robot joined him in his travels (although he rarely left the TARDIS). The Doctor met three of his previous incarnations when they were summoned to the Death Zone on Gallifrey by president Borusa, who was attempting to gain Rassilon's secret of immortality.\nAfter further adventures in which the Doctor re-encountered old foes, including the Silurians and the Sea Devils (\"Warriors of the Deep\"), both Tegan and Turlough left the TARDIS. Tegan would find the death and violence they encountered on their travels too much to bear (\"Resurrection of the Daleks\"), and Turlough returned to his home planet of Trion in the company of his younger brother, as well as other exiles of Trion, from the planet Sarn. The Doctor was eventually forced to destroy Kamelion, when the Master used his mental connection to the robot to regain control of him, a process the robot realised was irreversible (Planet of Fire).\nUltimately (\"The Caves of Androzani\"), the Fifth Doctor and his last companion Peri Brown were exposed to the drug spectrox in its deadly toxic raw form on Androzani Minor. With only one dose of the antidote available, he nobly sacrificed his own existence to save Peri, expressing doubt for the first time that regeneration might be possible this time, then regenerating into the Sixth Doctor.\n\nA sketch of the Fifth Doctor is seen in John Smith's book in the new series episode \"Human Nature\" (2007). Visions of the Fifth Doctor (alongside other past Doctors) appear in \"The Next Doctor\" (2008) and \"The Eleventh Hour\" (2010).\nSomewhere in his life he crashed his TARDIS into the TARDIS of the Tenth Doctor and consequently nearly opened a \"Belgium sized\" black hole because of the paradox caused, which the Tenth Doctor also uses to explain the notably aged appearance of his former self. However the Tenth Doctor, remembering the event, knew how to stop it because he recalled watching himself correct the mistake when he was the Fifth Doctor. (\"Time Crash\")\nWhen entering the Doctor's time stream in \"The Name of the Doctor\", Clara Oswald saves the Fifth Doctor (who doesn't notice her) from the Great Intelligence (having entered his time stream prior to her).\nAt another unknown point in his life, the Fifth Doctor piloted his TARDIS along with the rest of his first 13 incarnations to freeze Gallifrey in a single moment in time and save it from the extinction-level aftermath of the Time War (The Day of the Doctor)\n\n\n== Costume ==\nThe Fifth Doctor's chosen mode of dress was a variation of an Edwardian cricketer's kit, and he was even seen to carry a cricket ball in one of his pockets (which saved his life in one adventure). He wore a cream-coloured frock coat, striped trousers, plimsoll shoes, and occasionally a pair of spectacles. He frequently wore an optimo-style Panama hat that had a red band with a black and white pattern, which he would roll up and place in an inside coat pocket. The Tenth Doctor, who inherited various traits from this incarnation such as spectacle use, revealed in \"Time Crash\" that the spectacles were not actually needed to aid the Doctor's eyesight but were just for show to make him look clever (perhaps to counter his youthful appearance), although in Four to Doomsday, he makes a remark about being a bit short-sighted in one eye when questioned about the contents of his pockets, which included the aforementioned cricket ball, a book (The TARDIS Manual) and a magnifying glass. The Fifth Doctor's costume also retained red question marks embroidered onto the collar, which producer John Nathan-Turner added to the Fourth Doctor's costume in 1980. The Fifth Doctor displayed an unusually acute sense of taste in Planet of Fire, also inherited by the Tenth Doctor and the Eleventh Doctor.\nOn his left lapel, this Doctor wore a celery stalk. He claimed in The Caves of Androzani that the celery would turn purple in the presence of certain gases in the \"Praxis\" range to which he was allergic, although this allergy was not mentioned by any incarnations before or since. He said that if that happened, he would then eat the celery, adding \"if nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my teeth.\" In the same story, while attempting to revive a feverish Peri from spectrox toxaemia, he had noted that celery was an \"excellent restorative from where I come from,\" but that the human olfactory system was \"comparatively feeble.\" Supporting this assertion, in the 2010 episode \"Cold Blood\", the Eleventh Doctor asks if there is any celery handy after being subjected to a decontamination process intended for humans (which proved potentially lethal to a Time Lord biology). The Tenth Doctor poked fun at the celery in \"Time Crash\", describing it as a \"decorative vegetable\".\nPeter Davison stated in an interview on the DVD of Castrovalva that he thought the clothes he wore were far too \"designed\" and that he would have still kept them, but wanted to add some individual flair to them, as other actors portraying the Doctor have done in the past. In an interview with BBC Breakfast in July 2011, Davison stated that the cricket jumper was his idea, as the producers wanted something that conveyed both action and eccentricity.\nDuring production of the mini-episode \"Time Crash\", it was necessary to reassemble the Fifth Doctor's costume; this was accomplished through borrowing various items from the Doctor Who exhibition in Blackpool; knitting a new cricket sweater; procuring a new hat with the original band added; and Davison wearing the trousers that were originally altered for Colin Baker in the final scene of The Caves of Androzani.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nThe Fifth Doctor was first seen on television in the last episode of Logopolis, broadcast on 21 March 1981.  Davison played the role through the 19th and 20th seasons of Doctor Who, including the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors. Patrick Troughton (who had played the Second Doctor) reportedly advised Davison to move on from the role after three years to avoid becoming typecast, and acting on this advice Davison informed producer John Nathan-Turner that he would leave after the 21st season.  In a break from recent tradition, Nathan-Turner decided to regenerate the Doctor in the season's penultimate story, to introduce the Sixth Doctor to audiences before the seasonal break.  Davison's last regular appearance as the Fifth Doctor was in the last episode of The Caves of Androzani, broadcast on 16 March 1984.\nDavison returned to the role briefly in the 1993 charity special Dimensions in Time.  Beginning in 1999, he recorded a series of Doctor Who radio dramas for Big Finish Productions.  In 2007, Davison, at the age of 56, appeared alongside Tenth Doctor David Tennant in a Doctor Who special for Children in Need, written by Steven Moffat and titled \"Time Crash\".\nImages of the Fifth Doctor are shown, alongside other incarnations, in the episodes \"The Next Doctor\" (2008) and \"The Eleventh Hour\" (2010). He also appears in \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013), via archival clips.\nThe Fifth Doctor has also appeared in officially licensed novels, short stories and comics.\n\n\n=== Non-television appearances ===\n\n\n==== Short stories ====\n\"Birth of a Renegade\" by Eric Saward, Doctor Who 20th Anniversary Special\n\"Fascination\" by David J.

His knowledge of putting the ball in the right place and his high work rate are qualities that have been highly sought after in the current West Indian team. He often shared the new ball with his childhood friend Fidel Edwards.\nSince 1999 he was in and out of the team due to both form and injury. His main injury complaint has been stress fractures. At the end of the West Indies' tour of England in 2000 many had written him off as he again broke down. \nA determined man, he came back strongly and was part of the West Indies' World Cup campaign in 2003. He was recalled to the Test team where they hosted the Sri Lankans. After five wickets in the first Test, his career defining innings would come in the second. He led the charge to a seven wicket victory with 7 for 57.\nHis mature approach and accuracy with the ball was shown during India's tour of the West Indies in 2006. Collymore would finish with an economy rate of 2.33, a class above the more erratic younger bowlers. The younger Collymore bowled around the 90 mph mark but due to a back injury he was forced to remodel his bowling action which reduced his pace.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo profile"

He was a left-handed batsman and occasional right-arm medium-pace bowler.\nHinds played 45 Test matches for the West Indies between 2000 and 2005, and 119 One Day Internationals between 1999 and 2010. He also played five Twenty20 Internationals between 2006 and 2010. Hinds is currently the president of the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA), a role he has held since 2012.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHinds made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in 2000. In just his fourth Test Match he scored 165 against Pakistan.\nOften criticised for his lack of footwork, Hinds was a surprise choice as opener for the last Test of what had been a disastrous tour of Australia in 2000\u201301. Batting with Sherwin Campbell, the pair made opening stands of 147 and 98. He was however dropped from the side soon after and replaced by Chris Gayle who went on to cement his spot at the top of the order. During an ODI series in England in 2004 he was brought back into the side, again as opener because the West Indies were struggling to find a solid pair at the top of the order. For the next few years he formed a fairly successful opening partnership with Gayle. In Tests they put on 1300 runs together at 39.39 in 33 innings. Their ODI opening partnership saw them make 1687 runs at 41.15.\nIn 2003 he made successive ODI hundreds against Australia at Grenada, both unbeaten and both in victories for the West Indies.\nHis highest Test score of 213 was made against South Africa at Georgetown in 2005 and included 34 fours and 2 sixes. He put on 284 for the 4th wicket with Shivnarine Chanderpaul who also made a double hundred making it one of the few occasions where two players have passed 200 in the same innings. Hinds however struggled soon after and again found himself on the sidelines. He made a brief return to the side in May for an ODI series against India but failed to impress and lost any chance he had of gaining inclusion in the World Cup squad.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nHe has not played Test cricket since 2005, and his last One Day International appearance was in 2006 and in October 2007, he signed a one-year contract to play as a Kolpak player for English county side Derbyshire in the 2008 season.He played in the Indian Cricket League for the Ahmedabad Rockets in the first half of 2008, although he did not return in season 2.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo Profile"

        "article": "Pedro Tyrone Collins (born August 12, 1976 in Boscobelle, St. Peter, Barbados) is a West Indian cricketer. He holds the record for getting Sachin Tendulkar out on duck in Tests twice, the maximum by any bowler.\nHe is the half brother of Fidel Edwards. He is one of the very few left-handed seam bowlers who have had a chance to represent the West Indies cricket team. His bowling also is more dependent upon tidiness of line and length than the usual hit-the-deck kind of bowlers who have dominated Caribbean cricket. He shot to fame after getting Sachin Tendulkar out thrice during the 2001-02 India West Indies Test series, twice for a duck. Despite a decent Test record of 106 wickets at 34.13 he did not manage to secure a regular place in recent West Indies teams but was included in the 2007 World Twenty20 squad. In 2007 he signed a two-year contract with Surrey as a Kolpak player which placed his West Indies future in doubt, he left at the end of that deal.\nOn 30 March 2010 Middlesex announced his signing for the 2010 season.\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Lou Vincent (born 11 November 1978) is a former New Zealand cricketer and opening batsman. He has represented New Zealand in Test match, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket as well as playing for Auckland in New Zealand domestic cricket and  Worcestershire and Lancashire in English domestic cricket.\nIn December 2013 it emerged that Vincent was being investigated by the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit (ACSU) in relation to allegations of his involvement in the spot-fixing of dozens of professional cricket matches, including matches in the Indian Cricket League, the ECB 40, the Bangladesh Premier League and the Champions League Twenty20.In June 2014, the Bangladesh Cricket Board found him guilty for not alerting authorities that he had been approached and banned him for three years. On 1 July 2014, he accepted that he was involved in match fixing on many occasions. The England and Wales Cricket Board imposed a lifetime ban on Vincent playing in any form of cricket, applying to sanctioned matches by the ECB, the International Cricket Council or any other national cricket federation.\n\n\n== Early and personal life ==\nVincent was born in Warkworth, New Zealand and is the son of well known ABC NewsRadio sports announcer Mike Vincent. Vincent became interested in cricket at an early age as his father used to represent Eden Roskill Cricket Club of Auckland in first grade cricket and took Lou to all the international matches at Eden Park.\nAt the age of 15, his parents separated with Mike and Lou moving to Adelaide in Australia where Lou began playing in the age-tournaments. After Vincent was left out of several important age-group games by his coach, he decided to move back to New Zealand at the age of 18.When Vincent returned to New Zealand he had the opportunity to play for New Zealand in the 1998 Under 19 Cricket World Cup.\nHe played for Esholt Cricket Club of the Bradford Cricket League in England during the off season while continuing to play for Auckland in New Zealand domestic cricket. He also considered jockeying as a career and has umpired Australian Rules football.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\n\n=== First-class cricket ===\nVincent played for Auckland from 1997 to 2008 competing in the Plunket Shield First Class competition, the Ford Trophy Domestic One Day competition and the HRV Cup Twenty20 competition. In 2006, Vincent signed for Worcestershire to play county cricket for part of the English season. He had a fine debut on 25 June, making 83 from 91 balls to help set up a 50-run win over Yorkshire in the C&G Trophy.\nLancashire League side Ramsbottom announced that they had signed Lou Vincent as a professional for the 2008 season despite strong interest from the Australian domestic side Southern Redbacks in signing him. Vincent replaced the previous club professional, Sunil Joshi. Vincent had also played for Central Lancashire Cricket League side Rochdale in 2005 where he had an impressive league tally for the season of 656 before having to miss the last 10 games of the league after being called up for New Zealand's training camp ahead of a series in Zimbabwe.Whilst playing for Ramsbottom, Vincent signed for Lancashire as a replacement overseas player for the duration of the 2008 Twenty20 tournament. He replaced Mohammed Yousuf as the club's overseas player, who himself had replaced the Australian Brad Hodge \u2013 both were on International duty. Lancashire's cricket manager, Mike Watkinson, said that the club \"have brought in a player with a great reputation in the format who will add firepower to our top order. He is an exciting player and excellent fielder, just what we need for Twenty20 cricket\".Vincent made his debut during the Championship game at Old Trafford between Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He made 5 in the first innings and 19 in the second innings with the match finished in a draw. Vincent made his Lancashire Twenty20 debut against Leicestershire hitting 31 from 26 balls with Lancashire won the game by 52 runs.\nDuring Lancashire's seventh Twenty20 group game against Derbyshire at Old Trafford Vincent hit 102 from 63 balls which included 11 fours and three sixes with a strike rate of 161.90. Lancashire won the game by 9 wickets and Vincent was named man of the match. Through this innings Vincent became the fourth Lancashire player to hit a Twenty20 century, the previous players being Mal Loye, Stuart Law and Brad Hodge. The innings came after Vincent was controversially dropped for the Yorkshire home game 72 hours earlier which Lancashire lost by 4 runs at Old Trafford.\nVincent followed this up by hitting 56 from 36 balls in Lancashire's eighth Twenty20 group game against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford. The innings included 9 fours and one six with a strike rate 155.56. Vincent won the man of the match award for the second time in three days and helped secure Lancashire's qualification to the Quarter Finals where they were drawn to play Middlesex. Lancashire succumbed to a narrow defeat by 12 runs and were eliminated from the tournament.\nLancashire announced that Vincent was to stay on at the club as their overseas player for the remainder of the 2008 season. Brad Hodge, Lancashire's Australian designated overseas player for the 2008 season, could not return to play for Lancashire due to the ill health of his wife. Hodge had been playing in the Indian Premier League and for Australia during their tour of the West Indies and was due to return to Lancashire.In 2010 Vincent played for Northants in the T20 competition.\nIn the 2011 season Vincent represented Sussex for all forms of the game.\n\n\n== International career ==\nA right-handed batsman, Vincent made his Test match debut in 2001\u201302 when he opened the batting against Australia at Perth. In a bizarre New Zealand first innings of 534/9 declared which saw four players make hundreds but no one else reach double figures, Vincent made 104. He followed this up with 54 in the second innings.\nIn 2005\u201306, Vincent hit 172 in a One Day International against Zimbabwe at Harare to set a new record for the highest individual innings for New Zealand in ODIs, beating Glenn Turner's 171 not out against East Africa in the 1975 World Cup. Vincent's innings came off just 120 balls, and included 16 fours and nine sixes.\nVincent was recalled into the New Zealand squad for the Commonwealth Bank Tri Series due to the sudden retirement of veteran Nathan Astle midway through the series. Once in Australia he became New Zealand's most prolific run scorer, with three consecutive half centuries, contributing to three consecutive totals of over 290.\nVincent played in the early stages of the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean but after scoring a century and fielding well he caught a blow in the nets from Shane Bond and fractured his wrist. He was replaced in the squad by Hamish Marshall.\nAfter being dropped from the national team due to the implementation of a rotation policy and despite his good form Vincent suffered from Major depressive disorder and his contract with New Zealand Cricket was then later terminated with his signing for the Chandigarh Lions of the Indian Cricket League cited as the reason. Some commentators have mentioned unfair treatment of Vincent by the then New Zealand coach John Bracewell as the main cause for his departure from the national team.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nVincent has won five One Day International and one Test match Man of the Match awards.\nVincent has won two Twenty20 Man of the Match awards while playing for Lancashire in English domestic cricket.\nVincent won Lancashire's Player of the Month award for June 2008.\n\n\n== Achievements and records ==\nVincent equalled the most runs scored in boundaries (118 runs in boundaries) by a batsman in an ODI innings, when he scored 172 against Zimbabwe on 24 August 2005.\nVincent became only the sixth New Zealander to make a hundred on Test debut, and only the second to achieve the feat on foreign soil.\nVincent was chosen to represent the ICL World XI team during the 2008 ICL season.\n\n\n== Life ban for match fixing ==\nLou Vincent was banned from cricket for life on 1 July 2014 by the England and Wales Cricket Board for match fixing, after he admitted 18 breaches of the regulations including fixing the outcome of Sussex\u2019s match against Kent in 2011, along with Naved Arif, who received a life ban one month before him. Vincent released a statement on the day he received the life ban, admitting his involvement in match fixing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLou Vincent at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Charl Kenneth Langeveldt (born 17 December 1974) is a South African cricket coach and former cricketer who is currently a bowling coach with the South Africa national cricket team.\nAs a cricket player, he played all formats of the game. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, he played for South Africa between 2001 and 2010, primarily in One Day Internationals. He was the bowling coach for the national side.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nLangeveldt was born at Stellenbosch in Cape Province and worked as a warder at the Drakenstein Correctional Centre before pursuing his career in cricket. In 2005, Langeveldt was Morecambe Cricket Club's professional player; he later returned to the Northern Premier League for the 2007 season with Netherfield Cricket Club.In 2008, Langeveldt joined Derbyshire as a Kolpak player, before playing for Kent as an overseas player in the 2011 Friends Life t20. Langeveldt also played for the Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe made his Test debut in January 2005 against England at his home ground of Cape Town and took 5 for 46 in the first innings. His ODI debut came much earlier, in October 2001 against Kenya at Kimberley, where he took two wickets. He was rewarded with 4 for 21 in the following game at Newlands. Included in South Africa's 2003 World Cup squad, he played in only one game which was in the pool stage against Kenya.\nIn 2005, in the 3rd ODI against the West Indies at Barbados, he took a hat-trick in the last over as South Africa won the match by 1 run. He bowled Ian Bradshaw and Daren Powell before getting Corey Collymore LBW to seal the victory. It was the first ever ODI hat-trick by a South African.In 2007 he played in his second Cricket World Cup and after taking 5/39 in their win against Sri Lanka he became just the third South African to take a World Cup 5 wicket haul, which was also the first 5 wicket haul of the 2007 World Cup.In early 2008, Langeveldt was controversially selected in the Test team for tour of India, at the expense of the white paceman Andr\u00e9 Nel. This was widely believed to be due to an order from Cricket South Africa to select more non-white players in the team as part of its transformation policy, rather than performance. Langeveldt declined his selection, citing the controversy over the selection.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nLangeveldt has had two spells as South Africa's bowling coach. The first ran from June 2015 to October 2017, when Ottis Gibson took over the role. Langeveldt was appointed as the bowling coach of Bangladesh national cricket team in July 2019, but moved back to a coaching role with South Africa in December 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Africa cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCharl Langeveldt at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "In the sport of cricket, strict rules govern the method of bowling the ball. The rules relates to the bending of the arm at the elbow, the extent of which has always been open to interpretation by the umpires. More recently, the ICC has attempted to codify the maximum permissible flexing of the elbow as 15 degrees.\nWhen a player is found by the umpire to have delivered the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a no-ball and he is said to have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a suspect or an illegal action, or more derogatorily, he is said to be a chucker. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.\nOver the years, a number of players have been called in Test cricket and One Day Internationals, invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player has been able to modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career is international cricket is effectively ended.\nFor many spinners, especially off-spinners, they are susceptible to be called for throwing when they have a front-on approach because the elbow gets in front of the wrist upon release, especially bowling doosra.\n\n\n== Cricketers called for throwing in a match ==\nThose marked in bold were called for throwing in a Test match.\n\nErnie Jones (AUS) \u2013 called in 1898 at Melbourne\nC.

New Zealand needed one run to win with eight wickets left so Gower put himself on and bowled one joke ball to give New Zealand the winning runs. \nHenry Olonga (ZIM) \u2013 called in Harare in 1995\nGrant Flower (ZIM) \u2013 called in Bulawayo in 2000\nMuttiah Muralitharan (SL) \u2013 called in December 1995 by umpire Darrell Hair at Melbourne, January 1996 by umpires Tony McQuillan and Ross Emerson in Brisbane, and January 1999 by Ross Emerson in Adelaide - He demonstrated he is capable of bowling with a legal action by wearing a steel reinforced plaster-of-Paris arm guard (which works as a shield against him bending his arm) and bowling all his deliveries correctly. However, the calls for throwing were shown to be quite correct when tests showed a 14 degree bend when delivering the doosra, compared with the maximum under the then rules of 5 degrees. The rule was then changed to allow up to 15 degrees of bend.\n\n\n== Cricketers not called in a match ==\nPlayers who have been reported to the ICC because of official concerns about their bowling actions but never called in a match.

        "article": "Thomas Waymark (probably born 17 June 1705) was an English professional cricketer in the first half of the 18th century. He is one of the earliest known players on record and is widely accounted the sport's first great all-rounder.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\n\n\n=== 1720s and 1730s ===\nSurviving details of Waymark's career are few but it is known that he began in the 1720s and the earliest definite mention of him is in the 1730 season when a first-class match between the teams of his patron Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and that of Sir William Gage was postponed \"on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\". Waymark was last recorded in the 1749 season playing for All-England in a lucrative single wicket contest.Waymark was initially a groom by trade and was employed as such by his patron, the 2nd Duke of Richmond. There was probably no shortage of capable grooms and it is fair to assume that Richmond employed Waymark because of his outstanding ability with bat and ball, Richmond being the foremost investor in cricket at the time. Richmond's teams were representative of Sussex as a county and the few reports in which Waymark is mentioned make clear that he was the first great all-rounder in the game's history. For example, in the report of Mr Edwin Stead\u2019s XI v Sir William Gage\u2019s XI at Penshurst Park on 28 August 1729, it states that \"a groom of the Duke of Richmond signalised himself by extraordinary agility and dexterity\". It is generally believed that this was Waymark playing for Gage's XI who won the match by an innings.\n\n\n=== 1740s ===\nBy the 1740s, Waymark was no longer in the Duke's employ as he was working at Bray Mills in Berkshire. He is given as a Berkshire resident and playing for the Berkshire XI or the London XI.In the 1744 season, Waymark played in both of the two games of which the earliest known scorecards have survived. On 2 June, he played for London versus Slindon at the Artillery Ground. Slindon, backed by his old employer the Duke of Richmond, won by 55 runs. On 18 June, Waymark played for the All-England team against Kent at the Artillery Ground in the match which commences Arthur Haygarth's Scores & Biographies. Kent won by 1 wicket.Waymark was an outstanding single wicket player and took part in several big money contests. Single wicket was the most lucrative form of cricket in the 1740s. For example, on 16 & 17 September 1748, Waymark teamed up with Robert Colchin to play two doubles matches against Tom Faulkner and Joe Harris at the Artillery Ground. At the time, these four were arguably the best players in England. The matches were played for huge prizes of fifty guineas each. Waymark and Colchin won them both, the first by 12 runs and the second by an unrecorded margin.The last surviving record of Thomas Waymark is in July 1749 when he was part of an All-England team that played three single wicket \"fives\" matches against Addington, though Waymark did not play in the third match. He seems to have ceased playing c.1750.\n\n\n== Style and technique ==\nWaymark was a right-handed all-rounder who excelled at both the single wicket and 11-a-side variants of the sport. He was noted (see above) for his \"extraordinary agility and dexterity\" which would indicate that he was an outstanding fielder in addition to his batting and bowling skills.\nThroughout his career, the ball was bowled underarm along the ground at a two-stump wicket. It is believed that Waymark bowled at a fastish pace with variations. He was also an accomplished batsman, though not as highly regarded in this department as his single wicket partner Colchin. The bat was curved like a modern hockey stick and the batsman generally attacked the rolled ball. Batsmen did not develop defensive techniques until the straight bat was invented in response to the pitched delivery, which was introduced in the 1760s, more than a decade after Waymark's career ended.\n\n\n== Family and personal life ==\nNothing is known of Waymark's family life. He was initially a groom employed by the Duke of Richmond but latterly he was a Berkshire resident employed in some capacity at Bray Mills. Details of his final years are unrecorded and the date and place of his death are unknown.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAshley-Cooper, F. S. (1900). At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742\u20131751.

        "article": "Brendan Ross Murray Taylor (born 6 February 1986) is a Zimbabwean former international cricketer and a former Zimbabwean captain, who played all formats of the game. Taylor is a right-handed batsman but is also an off spinner. In 2015, former Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell described Taylor as \"our standout player for the last seven or eight years\".He captained Zimbabwe in ODIs until 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup, having taken over the reins from Elton Chigumbura after the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He became the first Zimbabwean batsman to hit back-to-back One-Day International (ODI) centuries (128 not out and 107 not out), achieved against New Zealand in October 2011. He repeated the feat again at the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. He was selected to play Twenty20 cricket for the Wellington cricket team as an overseas player in New Zealand's HRV Twenty20 Cup in December 2011. His 433 runs at the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup set a new record for Zimbabwe in any World Cup. His 11 centuries in ODIs is also a Zimbabwe record surpassing Alistair Campbell's 7.\nTaylor quit his national side soon after the 2015 World Cup but on 14 September 2017, he terminated his contract with Nottinghamshire to return home to Zimbabwe. It was announced that Taylor had decided return home and play for Zimbabwe for personal reasons.In November 2018, Taylor became the first batsman for Zimbabwe to score a century in each innings in a Test on two occasions. In October 2020, in the first ODI against Pakistan, Taylor scored his 17th century in international cricket to become the batsman with the most centuries for Zimbabwe across all three formats. Due to all these achievements, Taylor is often regarded as one of the finest batsman of Zimbabwe in the modern era. In July 2021, during Zimbabwe's home series against Bangladesh, Taylor played in his 200th ODI match. In September 2021, ahead of Zimabwe's third ODI match against Ireland, Taylor announced that he would retire from international cricket following the match.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nTaylor was nurtured by Iain Campbell, the father of Zimbabwean Test cricketer Alistair Campbell, at Lilfordia School near Harare. During his teens, where he attended St. John's College (Harare), Taylor emerged as a regular choice for national age-group teams and played in two Under-19 World Cups. He made his first-class debut for Mashonaland A at the age of 15. The very next year, he shot to prominence by scoring 200 not out in the B Division of the Logan Cup. Strong domestic performances and a mass exodus of top-level players forced Taylor into the national team at the age of 18 against Sri Lanka in 2003\u201304.Taylor made his debut for Zimbabwe at a time when many of the country's leading players rebelled against Zimbabwe Cricket (formally known as the Zimbabwean Cricket Union) and made themselves unavailable to represent the side. Consequently, to fill the gap, many young players were prematurely brought into the team, which weakened the side, especially at Test level. Taylor was one of the youngest and most promising in this lot. In 2006, despite not having signed a new contract, he was selected in the national team. Soon, he took over the wicketkeeping responsibilities as well following the temporary departure of Tatenda Taibu. He shot to international prominence after his 60 not out helped Zimbabwe achieve a five-wicket upset over Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.In July-August 2007, Taylor was re-selected for the Zimbabwe Select team against South Africa A, having not been available against India A. He scored just 15 runs (2 and 13) in the second first-class match, having been overlooked for the first game. With Tatenda Taibu back in the team, Taylor was no longer needed behind the stumps. In the ODI series against the full South Africa team, the entire Zimbabwe squad performed above themselves (including their highest ODI score against South Africa), but falling short on all 3 occasions. Taylor too had a good series, ending as the 5th highest run-scorer, with 105 runs at 35.00. Taylor's first Twenty20 outing was against Eagles in September 2006 and the second was versus Bangladesh in December 2006.\n\n\n=== Defeating Bangladesh, 2006 ===\nIn the 3rd ODI of the Bangladesh tour of Zimbabwe (2006), Taylor played a crucial role in a Zimbabwe win. A close game throughout, Zimbabwe required 5 runs from the final ball, effectively meaning a 6 needed to be hit to win the game. Taylor successfully hit 6 off the bowling of Mashrafe Mortaza on the last ball, giving Zimbabwe the victory, and contributing to their series win.\n\n\n=== The ICC World Cup 2007 campaign ===\nAfter a relatively unsuccessful series at home against Bangladesh in February 2007, in which there were some concerns over his commitment to the team, he was still selected for the 15-man squad to tour to the West Indies for the World Cup. With over 60 ODIs under his belt, he is the team's most experienced player.After a decent World Cup campaign, including 87 runs from 3 matches at an average of 29.00 (including a half-century; 50), Taylor went to play club cricket in the Netherlands, despite a ruling by the Zimbabwe Cricket board that any player leaving the country to play club cricket would be overlooked for selection.\n\n\n=== Defeating Australia, 2007 ===\nInto the action early, Taylor caught Matthew Hayden off then bowling of Chigumbura. Taylor was also involved in a first class stumping, which saw Andrew Symonds depart. Taylor also made a crucial run out, with only one stump to aim at, to dismiss Mitchell Johnson.\nWith Zimbabwe restricting Australia to just 138, by Twenty20 standards a poor score, Taylor also opened their innings. While Vusi Sibanda got the ball rolling with several quick boundaries, Taylor was the key man, and batted out the innings. With both teams reasonably even placed for the first dozen overs, it was when Brad Hodge came on to bowl his gentle offspin in the 15th over that Taylor turned the match in Zimbabwe's favour. 15 was scored from the over, including two massive sixes by Taylor, the longest of which went 77 metres. With 12 runs required from the final over, Taylor played a cheeky sweep which ended being 4 from the first ball. Followed by a single, a two and another single, Zimbabwe needed 4 runs from 2 balls with Taylor facing, Chigumbura at the non-strikers end. With a ball to spare, 4 leg-byes were scored, with the ball running down to fine leg. Taylor ended with 60 not out from 45 deliveries. His fine all round performance with the bat and gloves won him the man of the match award.In June 2008, Taylor joined the Lashings World XI based in England. This was seen as somewhat controversial due to reports of tension between Taylor and Zimbabwe Cricket Board, as a result of the board's policy of denying players to play abroad.\n\n\n=== Against South Africa, 2010 and thereafter ===\nBrendan Taylor scored 145* against the South African cricket team he carried his bat throughout the ODI innings and became only the ninth person to do so. South Africa scored 351/6 and Taylor scored 145 of 136 deliveries as Zimbabwe managed 287/6, yet again performing well with the bat but poorly with the ball. That knock proved something of a turning point for him, and he struck another century in the same year against Sri Lanka and proved Zimbabwe's stand-out batsman at the 2011 World Cup, with his upper-cut to third man being described by ESPNcricinfo writer Osman Samiuddin as \"one of the lasting images of Group A\".\n\n\n=== Return to Test cricket, 2011 ===\nFollowing poor performances in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Taylor was appointed captain of Zimbabwe on 24 June 2011, taking over from Chigumbura. He captained the side on their return to Test cricket, against Bangladesh, at the Harare Sports Club on 4 August 2011. In the first innings of the match he scored 71 and during the second innings he scored 105* and he then became the second Zimbabwean to score a century in his first match as captain, Zimbabwe sealed a 130 run victory and Brendan Taylor was named man of the match for his century.\n\n\n=== New Zealand Series, 2011 ===\nIn the ODI series of New Zealand's tour to Zimbabwe, Taylor unleashed his best form to date. In the 1st ODI, he scored 128* rescuing Zimbabwe from a precarious position to a respectable 231. In the next match, he scored another century (107*) leading the charge from the front again and in the process, becoming the first ever Zimbabwean batsman to score back-to-back ODI tons. However, he did not receive any support from the other batsmen and despite his tons, Zimbabwe lost both the games. In the final ODI, chasing a sizable 329 to win, Taylor set the tone of the chase with a brisk 75 off 65 balls, which enabled Malcolm Waller and Elton Chigumbura to give Zimbabwe a famous win. With 310 runs in the series at an average of 310.00 and a strike rate of over 100, Taylor was adjudged the Man of the Series. His 310 runs was at the time the record number of runs in a three-match ODI series. He scored 50 and 117 in the one off test match. By the process, Taylor became only the second Zimbabwean batsman after Kevin Arnott to score a century in the fourth innings of a Test match, and contained 5 huge sixes. Despite his half-century and his second Test cricket ton, New Zealand outlasted him to win a thrilling match. Despite that, Taylor said that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. In 2011, as a result of his fine performances, he was named the cricketer of the year and the batsman of the year.\n\n\n=== West Indies tour, 2013 ===\nTaylor only managed to muster a total of 33 runs in the two Tests against the West Indies, at an average of 18, in a Test series where Zimbabwe were comprehensively beaten by the home side, he also performed poorly in the ODI series, scoring 47 runs, averaging 15.66 with a high score of 39. He also played in the T20 series, only scoring 4 runs in 2 matches.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh, 2013 ===\nTaylor performed much better under home conditions against the touring Bangladesh in April 2013. He topped the Test batting averages for the two Test series, average over 106 a match, with a high score of 171 in the first Test at the Harare Sports Club, leading Zimbabwe to draw the Test series 1\u20131. In the subsequent ODI series, he captained the side to a 2\u20131 victory in the tournament, although failing to replicate his scores from the Test series. He also led Zimbabwe to draw the T20 series against Bangladesh 1\u20131.\n\n\n=== 2015 Cricket World Cup ===\nIn the 2015 cricket world cup Taylor scored two back to back centuries. The first one was against Ireland, where he scored 121 runs from 91 balls. Before the last group stage game against India, Taylor decided to retire from One Day internationals at the mere age of 29. In his last match Taylor scored 138 runs from 110 balls. He was congratulated by both his team and the opposition team India after he got out. He was included as a bench player in Cricbuzz's \"ICC World Cup 2015 team of the tournament\".Taylor signed for Nottinghamshire for the 2015 English cricket season. It was later revealed that financial security concerns among Zimbabwean cricketers was the reason behind Taylor's retirement from international cricket as well as that of Kyle Jarvis; another Zimbabwean cricketer, Craig Ervine, had rejected a central contract with Zimbabwe due to the same reason. It was also part of the reason why Zimbabwe-born Gary Ballance emigrated to England, and started representing England instead.\n\n\n=== Test career ===\nIn the Test arena, Taylor's performances were somewhat below what one would expect of a player at Test level. However, this was attributed to his young age and premature elevation to the national team. However, since Zimbabwe's return to the Test circuit, Taylor has shown remarkable maturity, both as the side's leading batsman and captain. He scored two Test centuries and when he scored a century in the fourth innings of the Test match against New Zealand, on a fifth day pitch, (inclusive of 5 huge sixes), he became the second Zimbabwean after Arnott to score a fourth-innings century in a Test match. Taylor has announced that his team will continue to play aggressive, attacking test cricket which drew widespread praise from all quarters. He also scored two half-centuries, 71 against Bangladesh and 50 against New Zealand.Although Taylor is primarily a top-order batsman, he has been in the past been successful as a part-time off-break bowler. He was Zimbabwe's first choice wicketkeeper, but gave up the wicketkeeping gloves after the return of Taibu behind the stumps. Following Taibu's retirement in July 2012, Taylor sometimes keeps wicket in ODIs and T20s but not in Tests.\n\n\n=== Return to international cricket, 2017 ===\nOn 14 September 2017, Taylor was released from his county deal with Nottinghamshire due to family reasons, thus eligible to play for Zimbabwe again. After 10 days of rest with the family, Taylor joined with Zimbabwean training camps for the upcoming international tours. In October 2017, he was included in Zimbabwe's Test squad for series against West Indies, and played both matches. He only scored a single fifty in four innings, whereas Windies won the series 1\u20130.\n\n\n== Domestic and T20 franchise career ==\nTaylor has been playing in Zimbabwe's domestic first-class competition, the Logan Cup, since 2002. His domestic one-day debut came for Mashonaland in December 2003.In the domestic circuit he is one of the most reliable and successful batsman, and in 68 first-class matches, he already has 4,719 with a highest score of 217 and a batting average of 39.99. In List A cricket, he has played 184 matches, scoring 5,528 runs, with a personal best of 145*. His average in those matches are 33.30. In Twenty20 cricket, he has 1,307 in 47 matches at an average of 33.51.Brendan Taylor was one of the star players in the 2007\u201308 Metropolitan Bank Twenty20. Taylor missed out on that elusive Twenty20 century by 15 runs when he scored 85 not out against Southerns in the second match of the tournament. Batting first, Taylor opened the batting and guided the Northerns to 3/227 after 20 overs, before going on to record a massive 158 run win. He also scored a second half century, 63 not out, against Centrals, a match Northerns won by 9 wickets with 6 balls to spare. Taylor was the second highest run scorer of the tournament, smashing 168 runs at an average of 84.00.He scored 95 in his only appearance for Northerns, in the 2008\u201309 Logan Cup. His team won the match by a massive innings and 290 runs.In the 2011\u201312 Stanbic Bank 20 Series, Taylor overcame a blistering ton by Chris Gayle to lead his team Mid West Rhinos to victory. The 171-run massive chase turned out to be a seven-wicket win with three balls to spare, mostly due to Taylor's match-winning knock of 75 in which he shared stands of 56 with the New Zealander Lou Vincent, and then a match-changing 105 for the third wicket with Gary Ballance, who made a quickfire 67 off 34 balls, including four sixes. It was the Rhinos' first win of the tournament.Taylor was given a contract to represent Wellington as an overseas player in New Zealand's HRV Twenty20 Cup in December 2011. He made his debut for Auckland in the 2011\u201312 HRV Cup game against Wellington. Wellington went on to finish bottom of the ladder, with just two wins from 10 games, but Taylor was the side's highest scorer with 207 runs, and the eleventh best overall.In 2013, Taylor was signed by the Chittagong Kings for $30,000. The King's got off to a poor start, however Taylor was one of the highest scorers in the league during this stretch. After the first 5 games, Mahmudullah resigned as the King's captain and Taylor was charged with the captain's duty. With his experience from leading the Zimbabwe National side and Uthura Rudras (Sri Lankan Premier League), Taylor led King's on a 4-game win streak. While on the hot streak, Taylor was the team's leading scorer and 3rd in the league with 316 total runs. Kings ended up reaching the BPL Final, but due to illness Taylor had to return home. Taylor-less Kings came up short in the final, finally losing to the Dhaka Gladiators.\nOn 13 March 2015, Taylor signed as a Kolpak player for Nottinghamshire, on a three-year contract. On the same day, he announced his retirement from international cricket.In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Khulna Titans team, following the draft for the 2018\u201319 Bangladesh Premier League. In December 2020, he was selected to play for the Rhinos in the 2020\u201321 Logan Cup.\n\n\n== Records ==\nTaylor scored 310 runs against New Zealand in ODI series in October 2011. This was the world record for most runs in a three-match bilateral ODI series until it was superseded by Martin Guptill (330 runs) in June 2013 and afterwards by Pakistani cricketer [Babar Azam] who currently holds that record (360 runs) Taylor was also the first player to score 300+ runs in a 3 match ODI series when he did it in 2011. He's also the leading runscorer for Zimbabwe in a 3 match ODI series with 310 runs.\nMost number of ODI centuries for Zimbabwe - 11 ODI hundreds.\nFirst batsman for Zimbabwe to score a century in each innings in a Test on two occasions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrendan Taylor at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Marlon Nathaniel Samuels (born 5 February 1981) is a former Jamaican cricketer who played internationally for the West Indies in all three formats, and a former ODI captain. He is a right-handed middle order batsman and an off-spinner. He was a key member of the West Indies team that won the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20, and was named man of the match in the final of both tournaments, becoming the first man to achieve the feat.\nSamuels made his Test debut in Australia in 2000, and his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka in Nairobi during the ICC Knockout Trophy in the same year.\nIn 2013 he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was one of the franchise players for the inaugural Caribbean Premier League. In 2016 the West Indies Cricket Board named Samuels as the ODI Player of the Year and the Cricketer of the Year.On 4 November 2020, Samuels announced his retirement from professional cricket. He had already informed CWI about his retirement in June 2020.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSamuels is the younger brother of Robert Samuels, who is also a former West Indian cricketer.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nDuring the West Indies tour of Australia, on 9 October 2005, Samuels registered his highest first-class score with an innings of 257. It was made in a tour match against Queensland at the Gabba. His effort was a record score at the ground, beating Martin Love's 250. Showing his allround abilities, he followed it up with 5 wickets in the next innings.The Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. An auction was held for teams to buy players, and Samuels was bought by the Duronto Rajshahi for $360,000. He was the team's highest run-scorer with 242 from 11 innings in the competition. In February 2012, Samuels signed a contract with Pune Warriors India to play for them in the 2012 and 2013 Indian Premier League (IPL). The 2012 IPL clashed with Australia's tour of the West Indies, and Samuels was granted permission to skip the three Test series and play in the league. During the tournament, he was reported for having a suspect bowling action, and was suspended from bowling for the rest of the competition.In October 2012, Samuels was selected for the Melbourne Renegades in the 2012/2013 Big Bash T20 League.Samuels helped Peshawar Zalmi to win the 2017 Pakistan Super League, and Kowloon Cantons to win the 2017 Hong Kong T20 Blitz. Despite his then recent success, he was not selected until the 8th round of the 2017 Caribbean Premier League draft, when he was picked up by the St Lucia Stars.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Debut years ===\nSamuels scored his maiden Test hundred at Kolkata against the Indians in 2002/03. His innings of 104 helped the West Indies to draw the 3rd Test and was made against the likes of Javagal Srinath, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. His first ODI ton came in the series which followed and turned out to be a series winning innings. With the series level at 3\u20133 going into the final match at Vijayawada on 24 November 2002, Samuels smacked 108 not out off just 75 balls. The West Indies finished with 315 and went on to win by 135 runs.\nHe played in two Tests on the tour of Australia in 2005, with a highest score of 29, before he was sent home with a knee injury.\n\n\n=== Permanent member ===\nAgainst Pakistan at Multan in late 2006, Samuels scored his second ODI century. His unbeaten 100 led the West Indies to victory as they successfully chased the Pakistani total. He fell just short of another century a month later against the Indians in Chennai but his quick fire 98 helped his side chase down India's 268. Samuels also played as part of the Pro Cricket league in the United States for the Chicago Tornadoes.\nIn January 2007, Samuels was named man of the match after scoring 94 and 40 in the first Test against South Africa in Port Elizabeth, a match the West Indies won by 128 runs. He went on to score his second Test hundred, in the final match, hitting 105 although it wasn't enough for his side to win the match or the series. Samuels was involved in the run-out of Brian Lara in his last international match, against England during the 2007 World Cup. Lara was on 18, when Samuels signalled for a quick run but was unable to reach the other wicket in time as Kevin Pietersen underarmed the ball to hit the stumps.\n\n\n=== Dropped from the squad & comeback ===\nAfter the World Cup, the West Indies toured England in May. Unexpectedly Samuels was not initially included in the squad for the Test leg, but was called up as a replacement when Ramnaresh Sarwan suffered an injury. On 4 July Samuels made 77 runs from 104 balls against England in the second Natwest ODI. He and Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored a record third wicket partnership of 175 runs at Edgbaston in a game West Indies won.\n\n\n=== Ban in 2008 ===\nOn 25 February 2008 Samuels was suspended from bowling in international cricket until he corrects his bowling action, which has been deemed suspect. Indian police accused Samuels of giving out team information to a known bookie prior to the 1st ODI between the West Indies and India in Nagpur on 21 January 2007. It was claimed that they have taped telephone conversations between a bookmaker, Mukesh Kochchar, and Samuels. The transcript was later released by the police. After a hearing into the matter, in May the International Cricket Council enforced a two-year ban on the 27-year-old for \"receiving money, or benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute\". Samuels maintained his innocence.\n\n\n=== Return in 2010 ===\nSamuels' two-year ban expired on 9 May 2010, and he subsequently returned to playing for Jamaica. West-Indian chief selector Clyde Butts stated that the door was open for Samuels to serve the Windies in international cricket provided that he proved himself on the domestic circuit. During the 2011 World Cup in February and March, all-rounder Dwayne Bravo suffered an injury and the West Indies Cricket Board asked Samuels to fly out to act as a replacement. Samuels declined, stating that he did not yet feel ready, but that he was targeting a return during India's tour of the West Indies in June and July.The West Indians were knocked out from the quarter finals of the World Cup, and in the team's first engagement after was hosting Pakistan in April and May. When the T20I squad was announced, four uncapped players were included and Samuels was recalled, marking a return to the squad for the first time since the expiration of his ban. Samuels returned to the Test side for the second Test and scored a half-century in his first innings.\n\n\n=== Golden years ===\nSamuels was selected in the West Indies Test squad to tour England after the IPL. In the first Test Samuels combined with Chanderpaul in a 157-run stand. However, with England batting on the final day to win the match Samuels was asked to bowl. His part-time off spin was called upon as the West Indies had entered the match without a specialist spinner, while Shannon Gabriel was injured and Fidel Edwards ineffective. Samuels scored his third Test century in his next innings, and combined with captain Darren Sammy to score 204 runs, the second-highest partnership for the West Indies' seventh wicket.Samuels was named man of the match in the final of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, in which the West Indies beat Sri Lanka by 36 runs to claim the title. He scored 78 off 56 balls, an innings which included six sixes and three fours. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2012 T20 World Cup by the ICC. Samuels was also named man of the match in the final of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in which he scored an unbeaten 85 off 66 balls to help West Indies beat England by 4 wickets and capture their second World Twenty20 title.For his performances in 2012, he was named in the Test XI and T20I XI of the year by Cricinfo.During the pool match against Zimbabwe in 2015 Cricket World Cup, Samuels scored his 8th ODI century. He along with Chris Gayle scored record breaking 372 run for the second wicket, which is the highest ever partnership for any wicket in ODIs. In the match, Gayle recorded first double century in World Cup history as well.Samuels was the West Indies cricketer of the Year 2016.\n\n\n=== Illegal bowling & drop from squad ===\nDuring the first test at Galle in 2015, Samuels was again reported about suspect bowling action. The action was found to be illegal for the second time and Samuels was banned from bowling in international arena for 12 months. His bowling action was cleared on 16 February 2017 by the ICC with the permitted 15-degree limit.On 4 November 2016, Sameuls was dropped from the ODI squad for 2016\u201317 Zimbabwe Tri-Series due to poor performances in tests against Pakistan in October.\n\n\n=== Return in 2017 ===\nOn 24 February 2017, Samuels discussed with WICB about the omission him from West Indies squad and suggested he could accept a Kolpak deal in county cricket. However, on 21 August 2017, WICB took the decision to include Samuels along with Gayle to return ODIs for the series against England.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nSamuels was involved in a controversy during the Melbourne derby on 6 January 2012 against the Shane Warne-led Melbourne Stars; during the Stars' innings, Samuels held back David Hussey at the non-striker's end when the batters were trying to take a second run off Samuels' bowling. Warne reacted angrily to this when he was later bowling to Samuels himself swearing and cursing; he continuously sledged Samuels, asking if he was going \"grab hold of my shirt too, Marlon?\" The incident escalated when Warne threw a cricket ball on Samuels, who responded by throwing his bat away. This led to an angry confrontation between the two mid-pitch. Both players were suspended, but Samuels missed the rest of the BBL season in any case, as he received an injury due to a bouncer from Lasith Malinga in the same game. The pair have been far from kind about each other in interviews since this incident.Samuels also has something of a feud with Ben Stokes; this began during the England cricket tour to the West Indies 2014-15. In the Second Test match, in which Samuels scored a century, he mocked Stokes' attempts to distract him with sledging as he batted, saying that it only concentrated his mind on the job in hand. When Stokes was then dismissed for 8 on Day 3 of the same match, Samuels saluted the departing batsman.The feud resurfaced during the final of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, during which Samuels scored a crucial 85. Stokes bowled the final over of the match to Carlos Brathwaite, with Samuels at the non-striker's end. After Brathwaite hit 4 sixes to win the game for the West Indies, Samuels claimed that Stokes \"never learns\".Tensions again arose between Samuels and Stokes in 2020; Stokes, who had been forced to quarantine while visiting his family in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic, later joked that the experience of isolation had been so tough \"he wouldn't wish it on his worst enemy\" - when asked if he included Samuels in that statement, he responded \"no, it's that bad\". Samuels responded on his social media with an expletive-laden post referencing Stokes' wife, which drew a negative response from many in the cricketing world. Among those to respond was Shane Warne, who told Samuels that he \"needs serious help\". Samuels again took to social media to respond, mocking Warne for having plastic surgery.\n\n\n== Bowling action ==\nIn February 2017, he was cleared to resume bowling in international cricket by the ICC. He was banned from bowling at the international level for 12 months in December 2015, after his action was found to be illegal for a second time in 24 months.\n\n\n== Other Ventures ==\nIn 2020, Samuels launched his first fragrance, named Sextillion.  Since 2013, he has also supported blind charities in the Caribbean, especially in his native Jamaica, through the Marlon Samuels Foundation. He hopes that he will be able to adapt the focus of the foundation's work towards fighting breast cancer in the near future. As his career has wound down, Samuels has also begun to focus on the music industry; he has released songs to his YouTube channel under the stage-name Icon7.\n\n\n== Records ==\nFirst player to receive 2 Player of The Final awards in ICC World T20 history. He also became only the second player after Shahid Afridi in history to score a half century and to take at least a single wicket in a T20 World Cup final.\nHe holds the record for the highest individual score in an ICC World T20 final(85) and also holds the record for the highest score in a successful chase in an ICC World T20 final in 2016.\nHighest ever ODI partnership for any wicket, along with Gayle - 372 runs for 2nd wicket and also it is the highest ever runstand in for any wicket in World Cup history.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarlon Samuels at ESPNcricinfo\nMyCricketLife"

        "article": "Ashwell Gavin Prince (born 28 May 1977) is a former South African cricketer and captain who played all formats of the game for South Africa. At the age of 29, he became the first non-white man to captain the South African cricket team when he stood in for the injured Graeme Smith in two Tests. He is currently working as batting consultant with the Bangladesh cricket team. BCB, however, has confirmed him till T-20 World Cup 2022. \nPrince started his career with Eastern Province in the 1995/6 South African cricket season. Since then, he has represented Western Province, Western Province Boland, Cape Cobras, and Warriors in South Africa's domestic competitions. He has also had spells in England, first at Nottinghamshire and later Lancashire.\nIn 2002, Prince made his Test and One Day International (ODI) debuts for South Africa. He played 52 ODIs between 2002 and 2007, and 66 Tests between 2002 and 2011. All eleven of his international centuries came in Test cricket, in which he averaged 41.64. He originally announced his intention to retire from professional cricket at the end of the 2014 English cricket season, but stayed on for another season before announcing his retirement for the second time in September 2015.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career (1995\u20132001) ===\nAshwell Prince made his first-class debut on 27 October 1995, playing for Eastern Province B against Griqualand West B in the UCB Bowl. Two matches later, on 1 December, he played his first match for the full Eastern Province team. Opening the batting with Philip Amm, Prince was dismissed leg before wicket by fast bowler Roger Telemachus without scoring in each innings. Recounting the incident 14 years later, Prince remembered the match as his first-class debut.Prince moved from Eastern Province to Western Province in the mid-1990s under the instruction of Duncan Fletcher who saw potential in him. Ashwell played two seasons for English cricket team Morecambe Cricket Club in his earlier career. Western Province won the 2000\u201301 SuperSport Series. After scoring 539 runs in the competition, Prince was named the club's player of the season. During the South African winter, Prince underwent an operation on his shoulder. His first match after the procedure was in February 2002 for South Africa A against the touring Australians.\n\n\n=== International breakthrough ===\nPrince made his Test debut in February 2002, against Australia at the Wanderers. His inclusion in the side was partly due to the quota system in South Africa. He however justified his spot in the side by making 49 and top scoring. In the third Test at Durban he narrowly missed out on a half century again but his 48 was influential in his sides victory.\nIn 2002\u201303 he struggled in series against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and was dropped from the team. With good form in domestic cricket he came back into the side in 2004\u201305 and played two Tests against the Zimbabweans. In the second match he made his maiden Test hundred, finishing unbeaten on 139. This was enough to get him a ticket on the plane over to the West Indies and in the fourth Test at Antigua he made 131 and set a South African 5th wicket record partnership of 267 with Jacques Kallis.\nThe South Africans travelled to Australia the following summer and then met up again on home soil. Throughout both legs of the series Prince had trouble facing up against Shane Warne, being dismissed by him seven times in the six Test matches. Along with his debut series which was played against Australia Prince had fallen victim to Warne a total of eleven times. Despite this he still managed a couple of good innings. The first came in the third Test at Sydney where he again batted well with Kallis and made 119. Three matches later but this time in South Africa, Prince top scored in South Africa's first innings at the Wanderers and made 93.\nDuring the Australia leg of the series the South Africans are said to have copped racial abuse with Prince being one of the victims. In the 1st Test at the WACA Ground in Perth during the 2005\u201306 season he alleged that sections of the crowd were calling him kaffir, a racial slur referring to \"African slaves\".\nLater in 2006 New Zealand played an away series in South Africa and after they managed an 8 for 593 declared at Cape Town Prince made an unbeaten 108 to help his side escape with a draw.\nWith Graeme Smith injured, who usually led the team, and Jacques Kallis unavailable, Prince was named as South Africa's captain for their two-Test tour of Sri Lanka in July 2006. He was their first ever non-white and Haroon Lorgat commented \"Ashwell's appointment is a non-event although the enormity and significance of it should not be missed\". Despite making two 50s in the series his side struggled and lost 2\u20130. The first Test saw Mahela Jayawardene (who scored 374) and Kumar Sangakkara (287) share a world record partnership of 624, and the second was lost by just one wicket while took Muttiah Muralitharan took 22 wickets in the series.In the ODI series which followed Prince lost the captaincy to Mark Boucher and it was a sign of things to come as he was not included in South Africa's squad for the Champions Trophy. Still in the Test side, he impressed during South Africa's home series against India, making a hundred at Durban after making 97 at Johannesburg. He finished as the highest run scorer for the series and his form continued against Pakistan, highlighted by an innings of 138 at Centurion. This form earned him a recall to the one day side and he was named in South Africa's 15-man squad for the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. South Africa were knocked out in the semi-finals, and Prince scored 107 runs from six innings in nine matches. He did not play an ODI after the 2007 World Cup and considering his ODI career he commented\n\nIf I look back at my one-day career my strike rate is probably a bit low [67.77] but then when I was selected in the team I was given a specific role. I would only bat if the team was 60 for 3. If we were 160 for 3, guys like [Justin] Kemp, [Mark] Boucher, or [Shaun] Pollock would bat. My role was to make sure we recovered when we were in trouble and if that's your role you can't strike at 100.\"\n\n\n=== Test specialist (2007\u201311) ===\nPrince started well in South Africa's tour of England in July 2008 with a score of 101 in his first innings at Lord's Cricket Ground. He scored 149 in the second Test at Headingley Carnegie. Back home, he scored a face saving 162 not out in the second Test against Bangladesh at Centurion, sharing in a South African record 6th wicket partnership of 271 with Mark Boucher.\nBefore the first Test of South Africa's tour of Australia in December, Prince suffered a broken thumb. Batsman JP Duminy was selected in his place. According to Prince, who in 2008 scored 900 runs at an average of 64.28 from 13 Tests including four centuries, he had been promised that once he recovered from his injury he would be back in the side. Instead South Africa persisted with Duminy, and Prince did not play another Test until the next series. Dropped from the first 12-man squad for the two Tests when Australia toured South Africa in February, Prince returned to the team for the third Test after captain Graeme Smith was injured and opener Neil McKenzie was dropped. Though he was used to batting in the middle order, Prince was asked to open in the absence of South Africa's settled opening pair. On his recall he was also asked to captain the side in place of the injured Smith, however the following day Cricket South Africa appointed Jacques Kallis to the role so that Prince could concentrate on his unfamiliar task of opening the batting. Opening with debutant Imraan Khan, Prince scored 150, his 11th Test century.Prince signed a contract to play for Lancashire County Cricket Club the 2009 English season. He acted as cover for V. V. S. Laxman, the club's other overseas player, who was unavailable at times because he was playing in the Indian Premier League. Prince score his first century for Lancashire at the start of May during a match against Nottinghamshire. The knock came off 135 not out from 189 balls came on the final day of the four-day match and helped Lancashire from a score of 39/3 to draw the match. From five County Championship matches Prince scored 497 runs. South Africa's next engagement in Tests was in December when England toured. Despite his initial success as an opener, Prince struggled to adapt and was unhappy batting in an unfamiliar position. He opened with Graeme Smith throughout the four-match series, and managed just 97 runs from 7 innings, prompting ESPNcricinfo's Firdose Moonda to describe his performance as \"technically inept\".The experiment with Prince opening lasted until the first match of South Africa's Test series against India in February 2010. For the second Test he returned to the middle order and Alviro Petersen partnered Smith at the top of the order. In six Tests as an opener, Prince average 27.44 runs per innings. In 2010, Lancashire signed Kumar Sangakkara who was unavailable due to international commitments until May. Due to his performance in 2009, Prince was signed as cover. After a run of low scores, Prince was dropped from South Africa's Test team at the start of 2012, and was replaced by Alviro Petersen for the third Test of South Africa's home series against Sri Lanka. When Cricket South Africa announced its central contracts in February 2012, Prince was included on the list and the convenor of selectors said that although Prince had been dropped from the Test side in January, he still remained part of the team's plan.\n\n\n=== Lead up to retirement (2012\u201314) ===\nPrince signed with Lancashire in 2012, the year they defended their title in the County Championship. Prince managed four half-centuries before registering his first hundred of the season. Until that innings against Middlesex the last ten times Prince had reached 50 he had not converted it into a century. Prince finished the season with 1,008 runs from 15 first-class matches at an average of 43.82 including two centuries; Lancashire, however, were relegated to the second division of the Championship. Prince was the county's leading run scorer, and the only Lancashire player to score more than 1,000 runs that year.In March 2013, Prince's central contract was not renewed. Later that month he signed a two-year extension of his contract with Lancashire, this time as a Kolpak player rather than an overseas player. Lancashire secured promotion back to the first division of the County Championship, and for the second year in a row was Lancashire's leading run-scorer in the competition, and this time registered three centuries on his was to compiling 1,169 runs.Prince had announced that he would retire from professional cricket at the end of the 2014 season. Explaining the decision in a BBC interview, he said \"It's for family reasons. My boys are getting big and starting to go to school. It's difficult to be in two countries for six months here and six months there.\" In June that year Prince registered his highest first-class score, managing 257 not out against Northamptonshire.Prince reversed his decision to retire and returned to Lancashire during 2015.  He was the county's highest scorer of runs for that season, with a total of 1478 runs at an average of just over 67.\n\n\n=== Playing Style ===\nA left-handed middle order batsman, he has a high-batted stance and is strong through the onside. He is noted for his gritty style of batting and also for being an athletic fielder in the covers.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn June 2021, Prince was appointed as the batting coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). Prince replaced Jon Lewis, who served as batting coach from January 2021, his tenure covering the home series against West Indies and tours to New Zealand and Sri Lanka, as well as the home ODI series against Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== Records ==\nSouth African 5th wicket record, 267 with Jacques Kallis vs West Indies in Antigua 2004\u201305\nSouth African 6th wicket record, 271 with Mark Boucher vs Bangladesh at Centurion 2008\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAshwell Prince at ESPNcricinfo\nAshwell Prince on Twitter"

        "article": "Mandy Yachad (born 17 November 1960) is a former South African cricketer and field hockey player who represented the South African national team in both sports. He is a qualified attorney, and an active business executive.\nYachad made his international cricket debut for South Africa in 1991, but only played one One Day International for South Africa. With much of his cricket career falling during the international sporting boycott of  South Africa in the 1980s and early 1990s,  Yachad was denied the opportunity of playing international career during the prime of his career. He was named among the South African Cricket Annual five Players of the Year both in 1985 and 1991. He was a specialist opening batsman who scored 14 centuries and 32 fifties in his 16-year first class career, which spanned 109 matches, mostly for Transvaal in two spells (1978\u20131983 and 1992\u20131994) and Northern Transvaal (between 1983 and 1992).  He was selected for the tour of India, and after Andrew Hudson made a duck opening the innings during a three-wicket loss in the first ODI in Calcutta, Hudson was replaced by Yachad for the second match at Gwalior. Yachad held the catch to dismiss Kris Srikkanth, the first wicket to fall in the match, but his batting was too slow to win the match; with the required run rate slightly above five, Yachad's 31 off 77 balls slowed the team down. He was eventually lbw to spinner Venkatapathy Raju, and South Africa lost by 38 runs. Yachad was replaced by Hudson for the third match, and never played international cricket again, though he turned out for an Invitation XI against India during the 1992\u201393 season.\nIn hockey, Yachad played at least 21 Test matches, and also represented his country at indoor hockey.He is an Executive Director at the Peregrine Group, joining in 1999. Prior to this, he was a Law partner at Werksmans Attorneys, practicing commercial law; he was with the firm for 14 years, nine as a partner.  He holds a BComm and LLB, both from the University of the Witwatersrand.He played one ODI for South Africa in 1991 against india and score 31 runs.\nHis son, Shaul, closely follows in his footsteps having played and captained the SA Maccabi Junior Cricket team at the 2009 Maccabi Games, bringing home gold with his team. Shaul was also voted fielder of the tournament.\nHis youngest son Ariel, is currently playing for Melbourne based Lordo Leggies at Oakleigh Cricket club in Victoria, Australia. Ariel is a hard hitting wicket-keeper opening batsman, with many journalist comparing his natural hand eye coordination to the great Adam Gilchrist. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMandy Yachad at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Justin Miles Kemp (born 2 October 1977) is a South African former international cricketer who played all formats of the game for South Africa.\nKemp is the 3rd generation cricketer to play first class cricket, his grandfather John Miles Kemp played a single match for Border in 1947\u201348, while his father John Wesley Kemp made three appearances for the same province in 1975\u201376 and 1976\u201377. His cousin is former South African international David Callaghan.\n\n\n== International career ==\nKemp made his International debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka on 14 January 2001. He made his Test debut a week later also against Sri Lanka. He was taken on the tour of the West Indies in the 2000/2001 season but he did not score many runs and was involved in a controversy when he admitted smoking marijuana with 6 South African players. He was selected for eight more One day games but again he disappointed and was dropped. He was out of the South African side for nearly three years until he was selected to play in the home series against England. In this series Kemp impressed with his big hitting with him smashing 80 runs from 50 balls in an innings that included 7 sixes. Following his performances he was picked for the series against Zimbabwe and in the match at Durban he hit 53 from 21 balls in an innings that included 5 sixes. He was then taken on his second tour of the West Indies where he made an impressive 65 at Trinidad.\nHe was then selected to represent Africa in the Afro-Asian Cup although he batted lower down the order and struggled. In the South African season of 2005/2006 he showed that he is a match winner when he blasted 73 from 64 at Bloemfontein. Kemp then went on his first tour of India where he showed he was able to bat on slower pitches. He went on the South African tour of Australia where he made a rare appearance in a Test Match when he and Jacques Rudolph formed a partnership that rescued a draw for South Africa at Perth. He was not picked for the second Test and has not been picked in a Test Match since. He struggled in the VB Series that involved Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa with him averaging just 17.00. He quickly returned to form when Australia toured South Africa as he made 51 from 41 balls at Newlands Cape Town.\nHe was selected in South Africa's squad for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India where he showed he is more than just a big hitter when he made 64 from 110 balls in a partnership with Mark Boucher where he along with Mark Boucher set the record for the highest 6th wicket stand in ICC Champions Trophy(131) 26 November 2006, in the third ODI of the series between India and South Africa, his side were at 137 for 7 when Kemp came in and smashed his way to his maiden ODI century with the help of Andrew Hall. Together they put on a world record 8th wicket stand of 138 and took their score to 274, with Kemp named Man of the Match. He also showed that he is a useful medium pace bowler when he took three wickets at St George's Park Port Elizabeth. He was selected in the 30-man provisional squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\n\n\n== Indian Cricket League ==\nIn 2008, Kemp joined the rebel Indian Cricket League, which was not recognised by any cricket board or the ICC, thereby ending his international career with South Africa. In the ICL, Kemp played for the Hyderabad Heroes team.\n\n\n== County Cricket ==\nIn 2003, Kemp played in England for Worcestershire, with a best bowling return of 5/48 in the County Championship against Glamorgan in June, and a top score of 90 against Hampshire in the same competition in September.\nOn 20 March 2008, the ECB banned Kemp and four other Kolpak players because of their involvement in the ICL. The decision was, however, overruled and Kemp was cleared to play for Kent, with whom he has a two-year deal. However, changes to the Kolpak regulations meant Kemp could not return to the county for 2010.\n\n\n== Indian Premier League ==\nIn 2010, Kemp joined the Chennai Super Kings franchise of Indian Premier League for $100,000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJustin Kemp at ESPNcricinfo"

Williams was a right arm seam bowler and after retiring he became the bowling coach at Boland.\nHe and Herschelle Gibbs were banned from international cricket for six months in 2000 for match fixing. In the hearing he admitted to accepting money from Hansie Cronje to underperform in a One Day International in India. He had been bribed to concede more than 50 runs off his 10 overs but he ended up getting a legitimate injury and thus only bowled 11 balls.Although his suspension was only for 6 months, he was well into his 30s and despite playing first class cricket until 2003/04 he never returned to international cricket.\nIn February 2020, he was named in South Africa's squad for the Over-50s Cricket World Cup in South Africa. However, the tournament was cancelled during the third round of matches due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHenry Williams at ESPNcricinfo"

Bacher married Shira Teeger in 1965, and they have two daughters and one son. His nephew Adam Bacher played for South Africa in the 1990s.\nBacher started playing cricket while at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg, and represented Transvaal at the age of 17.

He played in 12 Tests for South Africa, three against England and nine against Australia; he was captain in the last four. In a first-class match for Transvaal against the visiting Australian cricket team in 1966\u201367, he made 235 in the second innings, the record score for any South African team against Australia, took five catches, and led his team to Australia's first ever defeat in South Africa. He later played important innings in Test victories over Australia in the First, Third and Fifth Tests.He studied at the University of the Witwatersrand and became a general practitioner. He worked as a GP for nine years but left the field: \"I realised I was getting too emotionally involved with the patients.\"He captained the national team in only one series: in 1969\u201370 against Australia at home in which the South Africans won all four Tests. He was selected to captain the touring teams to England in 1970 and Australia in 1971\u201372, but neither tour eventuated, owing to anti-apartheid protests in the host countries. In 1972 he became the first player to make 5000 runs in the Currie Cup. He was awarded South Africa's Sports Merit Award (its top athletics honour) in 1972.\n\n\n== Administrative career ==\nHe left medicine in 1979 and briefly went into a family business. In 1981 he had heart bypass surgery, then took up the job of leading Transvaal's newly professionalised cricket administration. He was made managing director of the South African Cricket Union in the late 1980s.Believing that apartheid would not end in his lifetime, and determined to maintain the vigour of South African cricket, he encouraged tours by \"rebel\" teams from Sri Lanka, England, West Indies and Australia during the 1980s. At the same time he recognised that South African cricket had no long-term future unless cricketers in the non-white communities were encouraged to develop their potential, and he organised mass coaching clinics and development programs in the black townships.When apartheid began to collapse in 1990 Bacher immediately set out to form one body to oversee all cricket in South Africa. He asked Steve Tshwete, the head of the ANC's sports desk, to help get the parties to agree on a unified body. Tshwete soon forged an agreement and the two men became friends, travelling to London together in 1991 and successfully applying for South Africa's admission to the International Cricket Council.Bacher managed the South African team on its brief tour of India in 1991. He instigated cricket's first video-review system in 1992 and directed the planning for the 2003 Cricket World Cup.In 2005 he joined the board of the South African Rugby Union as the sponsors' representative.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\nChettle, Geoffrey A.

        "article": "Nico Boje ( boy-YAY; born 20 March 1973) is a former South African cricketer who played in 43 Tests, 115 One Day Internationals and single Twenty20 International for South Africa.\nBoje was a member of Africa XI team for 2005 Afro-Asia Cup. He is the first cap of Twenty20 Internationals for South Africa as well.\nHe attended Grey College in Bloemfontein. He is currently coaching the Knights cricket team in the Free State, South Africa. His brother, Eduard Boje, also played first-class cricket.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\n\n=== Northamptonshire ===\nBoje joined English side Northamptonshire CCC for the last few weeks of the 2007 season as a replacement overseas player for Johan Van der Wath. A few days later it was announced that he would be joining the breakaway Indian Cricket League. In 2008, the captain of Northamptonshire, David Sales, resigned and Boje took over the role as captain for Northamptonshire. In that season, he scored his highest ever First class cricket score of 226*. He signed a new one-year contract on 3 September 2009 which saw him lead the club through the 2010 season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nBoje's international career began in 1995 against Zimbabwe, and although he was in and out of the team due to injuries he established himself as South Africa's first choice spin bowler. Due to the amount of all-rounders in the South African team, Boje usually batted at eight or nine in the batting order, despite a first class batting average of 32 and both Test and ODI averages around 26, which was the highest for a regular number nine in Test cricket in the 2000s. However, despite the reasonably high average he never hit a Test century, although did make two ODI centuries against New Zealand in 2000\u201301. And also in that 6 match ODI series, he amassed 355 runs in 6 innings and broke the record for scoring the most runs in a 6 match bilateral ODI seriesIn December 2006, Boje announced his retirement from international cricket, effective immediately. He finished his career with exactly 100 Test wickets, the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene in his final Test brought up his milestone.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNicky Boje at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Maurice Omondi Odumbe (born  15 June 1969) is a former Kenyan cricketer and a former ODI captain for Kenya. Odume was suspended from cricket in August 2004 after he allegedly received money from bookmakers. He was appointed the coach of the Kenya national cricket team in April 2018. However, he was replaced as national coach by David Obuya in October 2018.\n\n\n== School time ==\nBorn in Nairobi, Odumbe attended Dr Aggrey Primary School and Upper Hill secondary school, where the right-handed batsman and right-arm offbreak bowler showed aptitude for cricket. \n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nOdumbe made his first-class debut in 1998 when Kenya played the touring England A side, making 16 and taking 0/29, and continued to play well for his local Nairobi side, the Aga Khan club. \nIn the year 2004, he hit a career best first-class score of 207 against the Leeward Islands.\n\n\n== International career ==\nOdumbe made his debut for Kenya on 4 June 1990 against Bangladesh at Amstelveen at the ICC Trophy, scoring 41 and taking 1/26, and had become one of their leading players by Kenya's One Day International (ODI) debut at the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Odumbe won the Man of the Match Award in one of cricket's biggest shocks, taking 3 for 14 in Kenya's win over West Indies.\nOdumbe was appointed national captain prior to the 1999 Cricket World Cup, winning a Man of the Match award against Sri Lanka for his 82 off 95 deliveries. Passed over for captaincy for Steve Tikolo for the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Odumbe played well as Kenya made the semi-final as well against India. \n\n\n=== Ban ===\nIn March 2004, Odumbe was investigated by the International Cricket Council following allegations of possible match-fixing and was found guilty in August 2004 of receiving money from bookmakers and banned from cricket for five years. While commentators at the time believed that the suspension would end his career, Odumbe has stated that he plans to return to cricket once the suspension ends. Odumbe has played 61 ODI matches, scoring 1409 runs at 26.09 and taking 39 wickets at 46.33, and 17 first-class matches, scoring 894 runs at 34.34 and taking 40 wickets at 19.55.\n\n\n== Returned to Cricket ==\nHe returned to competitive cricket at domestic level in August 2009, aged 40.\n\n\n== Beyond cricket ==\nOdumbe has been heavily involved in fundraising for shelters for AIDS orphans, as well as presenting a weekly radio sports programme and appearing in a number of television commercials. He was also planning to release a song and stood as a candidate for the National Democratic Development Union in the Kenyan general election of 2007.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNato, K.

        "article": "Ottis Delroy Gibson (born 16 March 1969) is a Barbadian cricket coach and former cricketer who played for the West Indies cricket team. From 2010 to 2014, Gibson was the head coach for the West Indies. He has been appointed as Bangladesh bowling head coach and previously twice worked as bowling coach for England, from 2007 to 2010 and again from 2015 to 2017. Gibson also coached the South African cricket team from 2017 to 2019.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nGibson's county cricket career saw him play for Glamorgan before taking up coaching with the ECB after a series of niggling injuries. However, he returned to playing with Leicestershire in 2004. In 2006, he moved to Durham. As well as playing for three South African provincial sides, Gibson has also made appearances for Staffordshire.Gibson signed a two-year contract with Durham in 2006. In his first season, he picked up 48 wickets and recorded a highest first-class score of 155, to keep his side in the division.On 22 July 2007, he took 10/47 against Hampshire, becoming the 79th bowler in first-class cricket to take 10 wickets in an innings and the first in the County Championship since Richard Johnson in 1994. Hampshire finished 115 all out, but despite Gibson's wickets the match ended in a draw.Later in 2007, Gibson bowled Durham to victory, again against Hampshire, in the Friends Provident Trophy. After setting 312 to win, with Gibson smashing fifteen off just seven balls, the Dynamos bowled out the Hawks for 187. Gibson had Michael Lumb and Sean Ervine caught by Michael Di Venuto first and second ball of the innings respectively, both for 0. He then had Kevin Pietersen out lbw for 12 to leave Hampshire 17\u20133, finishing with figures of 3-24. He picked up the Player of the Match award for his efforts. Gibson remarked after the game, \"Unbelievable. But we've got four games left and if I'm going to get through them I'm going to have to cut down on the celebrations a little bit.\"\n\n\n== International career ==\nGibson made two Test appearances for the West Indies. In his first outing against England in 1995, he picked up the wickets of Alec Stewart and Darren Gough in the first innings, finishing with figures of 2-81, but was less successful in the second with 0-51. With the bat he made 29 and 14, as the West Indies slumped to a 72-run defeat.His second appearance came in 1999 against South Africa.

        "article": "Matthew James Prior (born 26 February 1982) is a South African-born English former cricketer, who played for England in Test cricket and for Sussex County Cricket Club in domestic cricket. He was a wicket-keeper and his aggressive right-handed batting enabled him to open the innings in ODI matches, even when he made very limited appearance in shorter forms of the game. With an international Test debut score of 126, Prior became the first English wicket-keeper to hit a century in his debut match in early 2007. His glovework, however, was criticised. Despite a successful tour of Sri Lanka with the bat, Prior's keeping was less successful, and he was dropped from the team for the 2008 tour of New Zealand. He returned for the 2008 series against South Africa, and was retained into 2009, where he became the second-fastest England keeper to reach 1,000 Test runs, behind Les Ames. He retired in June 2015 from all forms of professional cricket due to a recurring Achilles tendon injury.Prior was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, and moved to England with his family at the age of 11. His mother is South African and his father is English. Prior attended Brighton College during which time he began playing for Sussex County Cricket Club. During his early years he played his colts cricket at St Matthias CC. He is married to Emily, the daughter of former footballer Sammy Nelson who played for Arsenal F.C. and Brighton & Hove Albion and has two children.\nPrior is the co-owner and chief executive of One Pro Cycling, with the cycling team racing at the UCI Continental level in 2015, and were promoted to the second-tier Professional Continental level for 2016.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\nPrior received the NBC Denis Compton Award for young cricketers three times in his career. He has hit more than 1,000 first-class runs over the course of two seasons, in 2003 when he won the County Championship with Sussex, and 2004, when his 1,158 runs, including 201 not out against Loughborough UCCE, was enough to be top-scorer for Sussex that season. In 2005 he made fewer runs, with 874, but also became Sussex's first choice wicket-keeper again after having shared duties with Tim Ambrose in the two previous seasons. He has won the County Championship three times (2003, 2006 and 2007) although in 2007 he did not take part as much as before due to his England duties.\n\n\n== England career ==\n\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 Zimbabwe, Pakistan and India ===\nPrior made his One Day International debut in England's one-day series against Zimbabwe in 2004: he was chosen to open with Ian Bell and made 35 before he was dismissed by Ed Rainsford in a 74-run win.\nPrior was next selected in the England team a year later for the ODI series against Pakistan. In the opening match of the series he made 45 while opening the batting as England won the match by 42 runs. In the next match he made 32 but England lost the game by seven wickets to leave the series level at 1\u20131. Despite his good start to the series, Prior struggled in the next three games. He made 2 in the third ODI before making 6 in the fourth match as England lost the game by 13 runs. England won the final match of the series, although Prior could only manage 9 runs. The series finished 3\u20132 to Pakistan.\nPrior kept his place in the ODI squad for the series against India. Prior batted well in the first game, making 22 as England lost by 39 runs. He made 33 in the next game but England again lost, this time by a smaller margin. He was run out while on 37 in the next game as England suffered yet another defeat. In the fourth game of the series Prior made 14 as England lost again, this time by four wickets. Prior did not play in the fifth game of the series, although returned for the sixth, batting lower down the order. He made 3 as England won by five wickets. In the final game of the series England lost again, this time by seven wickets, with Prior contributing just two towards England's score.\n\n\n=== 2007 West Indies ===\nMatt Prior was chosen ahead of Paul Nixon for the keeper's spot for the first Test of the summer at Lord's in 2007 against the West Indies. He scored a hundred on his debut, taking just 105 deliveries and hitting 16 boundaries after coming in at number 7, and finishing on 126 not out. He became the first England wicket keeper to score a Test hundred on debut and the 17th English batsman to record the feat overall. Although both Paul Gibb and Billy Griffith scored debut centuries, and although both were wicket-keepers, neither was actually keeping wicket in their debut Test. The last wicketkeeper to make a half century on debut was Jack Russell, who scored 94 against Sri Lanka at Lords in 1988. Prior was one of four centurions in the innings along with Alastair Cook, Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell. It was the first time since 1938 that four England players scored hundreds in the same innings of a Test match. Prior continued his impressive form into the next game, making 75 as England secured a victory on an innings and 283 runs. Prior again starred in the next game, making 40, although he was dismissed for a duck in the second innings as England won the game by 60 runs. In the final game of the Test series, Prior contributed 62, helping England to win by seven wickets. Throughout the series Prior made eight catches from behind the stumps.\nPrior scored his first ODI fifty against the West Indies, making 52 in the second ODI at Edgbaston. However, England lost the match by 61 runs. England lost the final game of the series by 93 runs, with Prior being dismissed for a single.\n\n\n=== 2007 India and Sri Lanka ===\nAfter making 19 in the first ODI against India, Prior followed this up by making 33 in the second ODI. He made 34 in the next game as England won by 42 runs. After making four in the fourth match, Prior made 46 in the fifth ODI before being stumped, as England lost the game by 38 runs. Prior struggled in the final two matches of the series, making a score of six in the penultimate game and being dismissed for a duck in the final game of the series.\nPrior was selected to play in Sri Lanka in the Test series. However, he showed poor form with a duck but then scored 63 in the second innings. Prior put some critics to rest with this and with his efforts in the second match of the tour at Colombo, when he scored 79, which was the backbone of England's first innings score, and ended the series with the third highest batting average for England, 41.25.However, Prior's good batting form was overshadowed by his poor wicket-keeping. It was the poor form with the gloves that led to him being dropped for the 2008 tour of New Zealand for Tim Ambrose, the Warwickshire keeper and former Sussex rival. When the squad was announced on 4 January 2008, Chairman of Selectors David Graveney stated \u2013 \"Prior performed well with the bat in Sri Lanka and it has been a difficult decision to leave him out of this tour, but the selectors feel that he needs to further improve his wicket-keeping in order to realise his full potential in international cricket. But I'm sure Matt will be back, there's no doubt about that.\" Prior considered ending his career as a wicketkeeper to concentrate on his batting, but decided to continue after speaking with Alec Stewart.\n\n\n=== 2008 South Africa and India ===\nPrior returned to the international scene firstly in the One Day International series against South Africa, after missing home and away series against New Zealand. After showing improved glovework, and the failure of Ambrose to hold down a position in the side, Prior firstly returned to the One Day International side for their 4\u20130 series victory against South Africa in the summer of 2008. In the first match he scored 42 runs as England won by 20 runs. He made an unbeaten 45 and took six catches in the next match as England secured a ten wicket victory. He continued his good form into the third game of the series to help England win by over 100 runs after hitting 33. He was out for a duck in the fourth game of the series before the fifth match was abandoned due to rain.\nPrior kept his place in the ODI side for the tour of India. He made four in the first match of the series as England lost by 158 runs. He made a patience 38 in the next game but England again lost, this time by 54 runs. Prior moved down the order for the final three games of series, but failed to make an impact. He scored five in the third match as England went 3\u20130 down. In the fourth match he had no time to make a contribution in the back end of the innings and in the final game he again did not bat as England lost the series 5\u20130. Prior was recalled for the Test series between the two sides and batted well in the first match, making an unbeaten 53 in the first innings and hitting 33 in England's second innings. However, India chased down a big target for the loss of only four wickets, leaving England 1\u20130 down in the series. He had little impact in the next match, scoring two in England's first innings and was not needed to bat in the second as the match ended in a draw.\n\n\n=== 2009 West Indies ===\nNamed in the Test squad for the away series against the West Indies, Prior played in the First, Second and Third tests. However, with his wife due to give birth, Prior returned to England to witness the birth, with Ambrose deputising. Despite Ambrose making a not out 76, Prior returned for the 5th Test after returning to the Caribbean. Following the return, Prior made his highest Test score (131 not out) in the final Test Match in Trinidad, and celebrated his century by mimicking rocking a baby with his bat to celebrate becoming a father. However, once again his glovework was questionable, as in the same match he broke the world record for byes conceded. Nevertheless, he was declared Man of the Match.He remained in the side for the return tour of England by the West Indies and reached 1,000 Test runs with 42 in the first innings of the First Test \u2013 the second-fastest England wicketkeeper to this mark, behind Les Ames. In the second Test Prior made 63 in the first innings to help England win the game by an innings and 83 runs and clinch the series 2\u20130.\n\n\n=== 2009 Ashes ===\nHe retained his place in the Test side for the 2009 Ashes, despite James Foster's apparently superior ability behind the sticks, as displayed to much acclaim during the World Twenty20. Prior had done well with the bat for Sussex in the County Championship, averaging over fifty, but had not kept wicket due to a hand injury sustained against the West Indies.Batting at number six, Prior continued his good form with the bat into the Ashes series, scoring a 62-ball 56 in the first innings at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff as England's middle- and lower-order boosted England to 435 all out, and 14 in the second innings as England held on for an improbable draw. In the Lord's victory Prior was bowled for 8 in the first innings as England subsided from 302 for 3 (Andrew Strauss 161) to 425 all out, but contributed a 42-ball 61 in the second innings as England sought quick runs; his partnership with Paul Collingwood added 86 runs in twelve overs. At Edgbaston he scored 41 in England's only innings in a drawn match, and held three catches in each of Australia's innings. Despite suffering from back spasms before the start of the first day, raising doubts as to his fitness to play, Prior offered a lone hand in the first innings at Headingley, scoring 37 not out as England subsided to 102 all out against Australia's seam attack; Prior aside, only Alastair Cook (30) reached double figures. He added a 29-ball 22 in the second innings, sharing a century partnership with Stuart Broad, but could not avert an innings defeat. At the Oval Prior scored only 18 and 4, but produced a sharp stumping on the final day to dismiss Marcus North as England surged to a 197-run victory in the match and a 2\u20131 victory in the series, thus regaining the Ashes. Prior's series aggregate of 262 runs was higher than any other England player bar Andrew Strauss; his runs had been scored at a Gilchrist-esque strike-rate of 82 per hundred balls.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nPrior was a key member of the squad that toured South Africa. He played in the first three ODIs, although he did not bat until the third match, where he made 16. He took two catches as England won the fourth match convincingly. After the final match was abandoned, England won the series 2\u20131. Prior struggled in the first Test, making a duck in the first innings and just 4 in the second. England went on to win the second test, with Prior making 60 off 81 balls. His attacking play helped England accelerate the innings and secure a comfortable victory. Prior made 76 in the third test, again scoring quickly as England secured a dramatic draw. South Africa won the final Test to level the series 1\u20131. Throughout the series Prior was praised for his wicketkeeping and counterattacking batting.\n\n\n=== Bangladesh and Pakistan ===\nIn the first test against Bangladesh Prior could only make 7 runs, although England went on to win the match. He hit a quick fire 62 in the second test as England went on to win the series 2\u20130. Prior had been one of the senior figures in an experimental team. In the return series, Prior was run out in the first game having made 16. In the following match he made a quick fire 93 which helped to accelerate the innings and guide England to a comfortable win. In the controversial test series against Pakistan, Prior struggled to make an impact in the first two games, recording low scores. However, he made an unbeaten 84 in the third test, which proved to be in vain as England ended up losing the match. England won the series and Prior consolidated himself in the team.\n\n\n=== 2010\u201311 Ashes ===\nPrior was ever-present in the Test side in England's successful 2010\u201311 Ashes Series in Australia. He started the series with a golden duck, the second victim of Peter Siddle's hat-trick on the first day of the series. He only managed a top-score of 27 not out in the first three Tests, however he finished strongly in the final two.\nIn the fourth Test at the MCG, he held six catches in Australia's first innings as they were bowled out for just 98. He followed this up with 85 runs as England won by an innings to take a 2\u20131 series lead and retain the Ashes with a Test to spare. In the fifth and final Test he scored his first century against Australia from 109 balls, the fastest English Ashes century since Ian Botham's 118 at Old Trafford in 1981. He was the third centurion of England's innings, along with Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, as England scored 644.\n\n\n=== Sri Lanka and India ===\nPrior played in the test series against Sri Lanka, as he continued to establish himself as a key player. He made 126 in the second game after not having to bat in the first test. In a rain affected match, Prior only made 4, but he did take five catches as England won the series 1\u20130. This meant that England had the chance to become the number one ranked test team when they played India. Prior hit 71 and 103 in the first test as he continued to stake a claim for being the best wicket keeper batsman in the world. He made another score of 73 in the second test, as England took a 2\u20130 lead in the series. England went on to win the series 4\u20130, and became the number one team in the world.\n\n\n=== Pakistan and Sri Lanka ===\nIn the first Test against Pakistan, Prior held the first innings together, making 70 not out to help England reach 192. In the second innings Prior could only make 4 as England again struggled with the bat, being bowled out for 160 and losing the match by 10 wickets. In the second test England again lost, this time by 72 runs. Prior failed to make an impact in either innings as England were bowled out for 72 in their second innings. In the third match of the series, England bowled Pakistan out for 99 runs in their first innings. However, after England collapsed, they lost the match by 71 runs. Prior was stranded on 49 not out in the second innings.\nIn the first match against Sri Lanka, Prior batted at 6. However, despite making 41 in the second innings, England went on to lose their fourth straight Test match. England won the second match to level the series, with Prior taking four catches and making 11 runs. This meant that they retained their number one spot in the rankings.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nEngland played South Africa in the summer of 2012, with the winner of the series becoming the number one test team. Prior made 60 in the first innings, leaving England in a strong position. However, South Africa made over 600 and although Prior made 40 in the second innings, England were bowled out on the final day to lose by an innings and 12 runs. Prior made 68 in the first innings of the second test. With England chasing 252 to win, Prior batted at 5 to try and force a result. However, he was run out when on 7 and the match eventually ended in a draw. England lost the final match of the series. After South Africa posted 351 in their second innings, England were set 346 to win. Prior gave England hope, making 73 and batting well with Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad. However, it was not enough and England were bowled out by 294, losing the series 2\u20130 and their number one spot. Matt Prior was promoted to vice-captain of the test side following Andrew Strauss' retirement and Alastair Cook subsequently being made captain.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nPrior was in top form as England toured New Zealand at the back end of 2012. In the first match he made 46 runs in the match as England battled back to a draw. In the second test he hit 82 but the match again finished in a draw as the pitches suited the batsmen and made it difficult for bowlers to make an impact. In the third test Prior made 73 in the first innings, before helping England to secure a draw with a stunning 110 not out. In the return series Prior got off to a nightmare start. He scored ducks in both innings, although England went on to win the game. Prior did better in the second game, scoring 39 and 4 not out as England won the series 2\u20130.\n\n\n=== Back to back Ashes ===\nPrior was not at his best in the first two Ashes tests, making a high score of 31. Despite this, he continued to impress behind the stumps. in the fifth test, Prior made 47, his best score of the series. Despite an indifferent performance from Prior, England won the series 3\u20130, with Prior as vice captain. Prior made his 200th catch for England during the 4th test in Durham, and he is third in test dismissals all time behind Alan Knott (250) and Alec Stewart (277).Prior had an indifferent start to the return series in Australia. In the first Test he scored just four runs. He followed this up with an impressive 69 in the second Test. However, in the third test of the series Prior again struggled for form, failing to pass fifty, meaning he had just one fifty in six innings on the tour. With England 3\u20130 down in the series in Australia, Prior was dropped in favour of Jonny Bairstow. However England still lost the following test in Melbourne\n\n\n=== Sri Lanka and India ===\nPrior made 86 in the first innings of the first Test against Sri Lanka after almost being given out first ball. He made 16 in the second innings as the match ended in a draw. In the second match of the series Prior made an unbeaten 27 after batting with the tail. In the next innings he was dismissed for 10 after being caught off a short ball. Prior made just five in the first Test against India, although he took six catches behind the stumps. He played in the second test despite fitness concerns, but could only make scores of 13 and 12. England lost the match and Prior later announced that he would be undergoing an operation on his Achilles, ruling him out for the rest of the series.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMatt Prior at ESPNcricinfo\nMatt Prior Archived 4 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine's profile page on Wisden\nMatt Prior on Twitter"

        "article": "Mohammad Asif (Urdu: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0622\u0635\u0641, born 20 December 1982) is a Pakistani former cricketer who played for the Pakistani national cricket team between 2005 and 2010. \nAsif was born in Sheikhupura, and has played first-class cricket for Khan Research Labs, the National Bank, Quetta, Sheikhupura, Sialkot and Leicestershire. He made his Test match debut for the Pakistan cricket team against Australia in January 2005. In 2010, Asif was ranked second leading Test bowler, just behind Dale Steyn.In 2006, Asif was involved in controversy after he tested positive for anabolic steroid Nandrolone, leading to the imposition of a ban which was later overturned on appeal. He was later withdrawn from Pakistan's World Cup squad with an unrelated injury. Further cricket controversy followed when he was detained in Dubai suspected of having drugs on his person and was then found to have tested positive for a banned substance during the Indian Premier League. In August 2010 he was accused by the News of the World of deliberately bowling no-balls in return for payment from a betting syndicate. On 5 February 2011 a 3-man tribunal, appointed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) gave the verdict that he was to be banned for 7 years, with 2 of those suspended if no further offences were committed. In November 2011, Asif was convicted, along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Amir, of conspiracy charges relating to spot-fixing. On 3 November 2011, Asif was given a one-year prison sentence for his role in the scandal.On 19 August 2015, the ICC suspended its previous orders and allowed Asif to play all formats of the game, effective as of 2 September 2015. He played in his first match after the ban when he represented Water and Power Development Authority in the third round of the 2016\u201317 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in October 2016.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nAfter impressing in domestic Pakistani cricket, Asif was fast tracked into the Pakistan test squad and made his first appearance against Australia in January 2005. He bowled 18 overs without taking a wicket and Australia won by 9 wickets.Asif was subsequently dropped from the side but he returned a year later in January 2006 for the home tour against India. In the second Test, Asif bowled 34 overs and took the wicket of Indian cricketerYuvraj Singh. It was the third Test in Karachi, however, where Asif would make headlines. After a poor batting display by Pakistan, Asif took 4 for 78 in the first innings, including the wickets of V. V. S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid and, once again, Yuvraj Singh, to help Pakistan take a six-run lead. Asif returned in the second innings with three clean bowled wickets of Virender Sehwag, Laxman, and Sachin Tendulkar to lead Pakistan to victory. His series against the Indians was blighted by a fine imposed by match referee Chris Broad for over-appealing and premature celebration of a wicket.\nThe ODI series that followed this Pakistan lost 4\u20131 to India.Asif followed up his match-winning efforts against India in Pakistan's next tour in Sri Lanka, where he took a career-best 11 for 70 in the 2nd Test, in another come-from-behind victory.In November 2005, Leicestershire announced the signing of Asif for the 2006 season after he had played a game for their second XI in 2004. Leicestershire's chairman Neil Davidson described him as a \"bowler with the ability to generate great pace\". Asif did relatively well picking up 25 wickets in 7 first-class games before leaving to join the Pakistan squad for their tour of England. Asif was due to line up again with Leicestershire for the 2007 season but due to injury problems was asked not to play by the PCB.Asif missed the first three Tests in Pakistan's tour to England in the summer of 2006, but returned to the side for the fourth Test and immediately made an impact, picking up four wickets (Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Paul Collingwood and Kevin Pietersen) in the first innings at the Oval, and another in the second (Marcus Trescothick).\n\nHe became the first bowler to bowl a maiden over in Twenty20 cricket. In fact, he managed to pick up two wickets during that over, first of Kevin Pietersen for a golden duck and then of Andrew Strauss, also without scoring. Kevin Pietersen remembers Asif's spell and recently in talking with Twitter wrote \" I think there\u2019s plenty batters around the world that were happy he got banned! He was the best I faced! I had no idea against him!\"A lot was made of the duel between Asif and Pietersen in matches between them.Asif claimed 19 wickets abroad in Pakistan's test series against South Africa in 2007. This feat lifted him to eighth in the LG ICC Test player rankings after only nine appearances \u2013 equalling the record for the fewest matches taken by a Pakistan bowler to reach the top 10, shared by Waqar Younis and Pervez Sajjad. His spell was of 5 for 76 named as the third-best Test bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo voters.Following the 2\u20131 test series loss against South Africa, Pakistan captain Inzamam-Ul-Haq praised Asif's performance, \"Asif has immaculate length control and a natural ability to swing the ball both ways. He is also quick to spot a weakness in batsmen and work on it.\" Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer added, \"He [Asif] is a modern-day fast bowler based on the likes of [Shaun] Pollock and [Glenn] McGrath. He gives you control and has the ability to hit the seam and make the ball move both ways. In Pakistan terms he is more Sarfraz Nawaz than Imran Khan.For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World Test XI by ICCFormer Pakistan captain Imran Khan agreed with the assessment of Asif's progress, saying: \"Asif is well on his way to become one of the greats. If he gains a little bit of pace through weight training he can be more lethal.\"In August 2007, he joined the Indian Premier League (IPL) He was subsequently drafted by the Delhi DareDevils for US$650,000.\nIn the week before the 2007 Twenty20 world cup match in South Africa, Shoaib Akhtar was rumoured to have hit Asif with a bat, leaving a bruise on his left thigh. According to sources, the two were involved in a dressing room spat which resulted in Asif being struck by a bat on his left thigh. Sources said the fight between the two started after Asif and Shahid Afridi disagreed with Shoaib that he shared the same stature as Imran Khan in Pakistan cricket and even ridiculed him for making such a comparison. The injury was not thought to be anything more serious than a bruise but a team investigation into the matter was pending. After the initial inquiry, it would found that Shoaib was at fault and he was subsequently recalled from the Twenty20 World Cup squad and was sent home. He was also banned for 5 matches by the PCB and a lifetime ban may also seem imminent. Akhtar later claimed that Afridi was responsible for the fight, saying \"He made some ill remarks about my family. And I could not tolerate them\" Afridi however, denied these allegations adding that Asif would have suffered more injuries but for his intervention. Even Asif chipped in saying that Shoaib was lying and that \"Shahid Afridi had nothing to do with the fight.\" saying that \"he has not apologised to me. \" His spell of 4 for 18 was named as the second-best T20I bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo voters.Conversely, Asif jointly holds the Test record with five consecutive ducks, an unfortunate honour he shares with Bob Holland and Ajit Agarkar.\n\n\n=== Spot fixing scandal and seven-year ban (2010\u20132017) ===\n\nIn August 2010, the English Sunday newspaper News of the World published allegations that Asif and fellow bowler Mohammad Amir had deliberately bowled no-balls during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England in return for payment from a betting syndicate, a practice known as spot-fixing.\nOn 1 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Asif under the provision of the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players (Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt) were charged \"under various offences under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behaviour during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\".\nAfter filing his appeal against the suspension he withdrew it stating that he wanted the Scotland Yard investigation to be completed before he files an appeal against his ban as he knows what the charges levelled against him are In December Salman Butt one of the three cricketers implicated along with Asif and Amir announced that he wanted his hearing to be delayed because he wanted the Scotland Yard investigation to be completed first. Asif and Amir stated they would not take part in the teleconference involving Butt for requesting the delay in the hearing because they wanted their decisions to happen quickly so that they could be selected in Pakistan's provisional world cup squadOn 5 February 2011, the tribunal's decision was handed down. Asif was found guilty of deliberately bowling no-balls, and was banned from the sport of cricket for seven years, the last two of which were suspended should no further offences take place, and Asif take part in a Pakistani Cricket Board anti-corruption program.On 1 November 2011, Asif was convicted at Southwark Crown Court, along with Amir and Butt, of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments.On 3 May 2012, Asif completed his punishment and was released from HM Prison Canterbury, England.\n\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nOn 16 October 2006, Asif was suspended by the PCB along with teammate Shoaib Akhtar, and was pulled from the Champions Trophy after the pair failed drug tests for the performance-enhancing substance Nandrolone.England batsman Andrew Strauss said the news had rocked cricket. Speaking on BBC Radio Five Live, he said: \"When drugs are used in any sport it is not a great day for that sport and this not a great day for cricket.\"On 1 November 2006, the PCB handed down a two-year suspension to Shoaib Akhtar and a one-year suspension to Asif, banning them from professional cricket for the duration. Both Asif and Shoaib have been added to Pakistan Olympic Association list of doping offenders. The tribunal set to investigate steroid use revealed that Asif had been using a protein supplement, Promax-50. The panel had reported to have shown a degree of leniency to Asif as they believe that he did not understand what he was taking and stopped at the request of the physiotherapist. Both Akhtar and Asif appealed against the ban. A second tribunal was formed. On 5 December both were acquitted by the tribunal appointed to review their drug ban appeal. The decision was made two to one with Hasib Ahsan and Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim in favour of the acquittal. Statement by Justice Ebrahim:\n\"This appeal committee [therefore] holds that Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif will not be deemed to have committed a doping offence,\" Ibrahim said. \"The ban and punishment imposed by the earlier tribunal is hereby set aside as being contrary to the provision of laws.\"However, the WADA, World Anti-Doping Agency was unhappy with the decision and was to challenge the decision to lift the bans on the fast bowlers, and taking the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. The ICC, cricket's world governing body, has supported the WADA appeal adding that it was committed to a dope free game.On 6 December 2006, Asif spoke out in his defence in an interview with the BBC. When asked to explain the presence of Nandrolone in his body, Asif cited a lack of awareness in Asian countries and said that he had taken some vitamins and protein supplements during the team's 2006 tour of England, which led to the problem. He also mentioned that medicines are easier to obtain in Pakistan, with little information available about the quality of the medicines.On 1 March 2007, Akhtar and Asif were ruled out of the Pakistani squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup by team officials, minutes before the squad was to depart for the West Indies. The team management along with the PCB said their injuries were too severe to risk taking them to the Caribbean. Since neither of the two had been declared fit they had not undergone official doping tests. However, Pakistani officials told cricket sources off the record that the team management had feared that they would fail the doping tests as it was likely traces of Nandrolone were still present in their system.However, on 2 July 2007, the Court of Arbitration for Sport later dropped the case, ruling it had no jurisdiction to challenge the decision made by PCB.On 1 June 2008, Asif was detained at Dubai International Airport on suspicion of possessing illegal drugs. An unknown substance was found in Asif's wallet, and was sent for analysis along with a sample of Asif's urine. The PCB appointed a legal counsel to represent Asif, and sent a senior board official to Dubai to handle the case. Asif was withdrawn from Pakistan's squad for the upcoming tri-series in Bangladesh and replaced by newcomer Sohail Khan.On 19 June 2008, the charges against Asif were dropped by the Dubai public prosecutor due to \"insignificance.\" The prosecutor, Mohammad Al Nuaimi, was quoted as saying, \"It is definite that he committed the crime as he was caught red-handed ... however in certain cases and for a faster litigation process the Public Prosecution drops a case due to insignificance and deports the suspect.\"He was banned from entering UAE ever again. Asif returned to Pakistan the following day and thanked those who had aided his release, he also stated, \"I did not use any banned substance. During the Indian Premier League, I underwent two doping tests, and cleared both of them...If I had been tested positive, the ICC would not have cleared me.\" His alleged aiders include the Pakistani actress, Veena Malik, who recently claimed that Asif has not returned her loan amounting to PKR 13 million, which was used for his release.In July 2008, soon after his return to Pakistan from Dubai, the IPL revealed that a player had tested positive for banned substances during the tournament and on 14 July, it was revealed that the player in question was Asif.Asif protested his innocence, and his lawyer announced that his 'B' sample would be analysed as per WADA regulations, and he was later suspended from all cricket indefinitely by the PCB. He does have the right to appeal his suspension. On 11 February 2009, the IPL confirmed that Asif had tested positive for steroids and subsequently imposed a one-year ban on him, ending on 21 September 2009. Shortly before the IPL's announcement, Asif was released of his contract by the Delhi DareDevils.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nAsif was signed for his first acting role for a Bollywood film in 2010, however he was dropped due to the allegations against him. He was then replaced by Canadian actor Abbas Hasan in Mazhavillinattam Vare directed by Kaithapram Damodaran Namboothiri.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPublic and media reports in Pakistan surfaced that Asif had married Pakistani actress and model, on 28 May 2009, in a private ceremony in London. However it was denied later that the marriage had taken place.In April 2010, Veena Malik filed a complaint against Asif claiming that he threatened to harm her if she did not stop pursuing her demand that he return the loan of around Rs 14 million he had taken from her. Later, she served a legal notice on Asif, after two cheques he gave her to settle the outstanding amount were bounced.\nOn 2 March 2010, Asif announced his engagement to Sania Hilal in Lahore. The couple wed on 1 October 2010, and Asif was reported as stating that he hoped marriage would change his life in a positive way. Attendees included Pakistan Test cricket captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammad Asif at ESPNcricinfo\nMohammad Asif Player Profile & Stats on Cricket.com.pk"

        "article": "Charl Myles Willoughby (born 3 December 1974) is a retired South African cricketer who played two Tests and three One Day Internationals for South Africa between 2000 and 2003. He played for Boland and Western Province before spending two seasons with the Cape Cobras. He has also played English county cricket, and after a season with Leicestershire in 2005, and played for Somerset from 2006 to 2011 and Essex in 2012. He is a left-arm fast-medium pace bowler and a left-handed batsman. He was educated at Wynberg Boys' High School, and Windsor (now Kenwyn) Primary School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nWilloughby made his one-day debut for Boland in October 1994 against Orange Free State. Opening the Boland bowling, he finished the match with 1/44, claiming future South Africa national team head coach Mickey Arthur as his first wicket. His first-class debut came just under two weeks later, against Transvaal. Willoughby claimed three wickets in the first-innings, and two more in the second as the match was drawn. He finished his first season with 15 first-class wickets, at a bowling average of 35.73. In the 1998\u201399 season, a string of good performances saw Willoughby selected to play for South Africa A against the touring West Indians. Although his first match in international colours passed without him standing-out, in the following match for Boland, also against the West Indians, Willoughby claimed his maiden five-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 5/60, including the wicket of Brian Lara. By the end of the season, he had claimed 36 first-class wickets, almost double the number he had taken previous to that summer. He made his international debut late in the following 1999\u20132000 season, appearing in a Coca-Cola Sharjah Cup match against Pakistan. Opening the bowling, Willoughby claimed two wickets in a 65 run defeat.After spending the winter playing club cricket in England, Willoughby was selected to tour the West Indies with South Africa A, where he played two matches against Barbados and four against West Indies A. He joined Western Province for the 2000\u201301 season, where he remained until the end of the 2004\u201305 season, when he joined Cape Cobras.\nThree wickets for South Africa A in each of the one-day matches against 'The Rest' in February 2003 led to his inclusion in the One Day International (ODI) squad for the 2003 TVS Cup in Bangladesh. He played twice in the tournament without taking a wicket, and hasn't appeared for South Africa in ODIs since. His Test debut came during the same tour, during the first Test against Bangladesh in April 2003. He claimed a solitary wicket, that of Mohammad Ashraful during the match. He retained his place in the Test squad for the tour of England, playing in three tour matches and the first Test at Edgbaston. In a drawn match, he bowled 20 overs in the first-innings without taking a wicket, and wasn't asked by captain Graeme Smith to bowl in the second.\n\n\n=== England ===\nHe has also played for Leicestershire in 2005 and for Somerset from 2006. In 2006 he was the leading wicket taker for Somerset in first-class cricket as he took 66 wickets at an average of just over 25 in a season which included career bests of 47 batting against Worcestershire and 7/44 against Gloucestershire. He also performed consistently in 2007, a season in which Somerset achieved promotion to the first division of the County Championship as well as the Natwest Pro40. It was announced in November 2011 that Willoughby has joined Essex on a two-year deal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCharl Willoughby at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Salman Butt (Urdu: \u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0679 \u200e, born 7 October 1984) is a former Pakistani cricketer who played for Pakistan national cricket team between 2003 and 2010, before getting banned for five years for his involvement in 2010 spot-fixing scandal.He had been a regular Test and ODI left-handed opening batsman. He made his Test debut on 3 September 2003 in the third Test against Bangladesh, and a year later, made his ODI debut against West Indies on 22 September 2004. He was appointed captain of the Pakistan Test squad on 16 July 2010. He was known for his command in offside area.\nHis noticeable performance was against India, registering 5 ODI centuries in 21 innings with an average of 52.On 29 August 2010, he was implicated in allegations of spot-fixing. On 31 August 2010, he was stripped of the Pakistan captaincy, and removed from the ODI  squad pending criminal proceedings. He was banned from playing cricket for ten years, of which five years was a suspended sentence. In November 2011, he was convicted and jailed for 30 months for conspiracy charges relating to the spot-fixing, along with Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif. On 21 June 2012, he was released from jail.In August 2015, bans on Butt and fellow conspirators Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were lifted by the International Cricket Council, allowing them to return to all forms of cricket from 2 September 2015.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nButt started in the Under-17s and quickly progressed through Under-19 level, although at that time he was much younger than the age limits suggest, making his senior debut for Lahore Whites in 2000 aged only 15. His talent was noticed immediately, which led to him being given a place in the Pakistan A team against England soon after. However, instead of rushing straight for the limelight of international cricket, he got his head down and consolidated by playing consistently for his region and the youth teams, until the Pakistan selectors finally drafted him in 2003.\n\n\n=== International cricket ===\nAfter his debut, Butt was dropped, and he struggled to regain his place due to some stiff competition for the openers' spots. He returned for the Champions' Trophy in 2004 and scored his first fifty for Pakistan in the Paktel Cup against Sri Lanka. In the ODI against India on 13 November 2004, as Pakistan chased down 292, he formed partnerships first with Shoaib Malik, putting on 113, and subsequently with Inzamam-Ul-Haq. Despite having retired for seven overs due to severe cramp, he returned to steer Pakistan home, finishing on 108 not out.Yet 2005 saw little improvement, and doubts circulated about his defensive technique, causing him to be shuffled in and out of the side. But things started looking up again during the winter Test series against England, in which he scored a century and two fifties, with a more cautious attitude to his innings building than he had previously shown.For his performances in 2008, he was named as 12th man in the World ODI XI by the ICC.\n\n\n=== Appointment as Test captain ===\nOn 17 July 2010, the Pakistan Cricket Board appointed Butt as captain of the Pakistani Test squad in place of Shahid Afridi, who announced his retirement from Test cricket after Pakistan lost the first test match against Australia. He became the 28th captain of the Pakistani Test team and the fifth to lead them since January 2009.On 23 July 2010, Salman Butt led Pakistan to victory against Australia in his first appearance as Pakistan's test team captain.\n\n\n=== Spot-fixing scandal ===\n\nIn August 2010, Butt and two other players, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif, were among those named by a News of the World sting where undercover reporters paid an agent loosely affiliated with several players on Pakistan's squad a bribe in return for detailed information on when no-balls would be bowled.\nButt, Amir, and Asif were dropped from the Pakistan team for the limited-over series (two Twenty20 games, and five ODI games). However, on 2 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Asif, Amir and Butt under the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players were charged \"under various offences under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behaviour during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\".Later it became known that Butt and the other two players implicated in the scandal were in possession of bills with the same serial numbers as those the reporter had paid Majeed earlier. Butt was provisionally suspended from playing International Cricket due to the fact that the ICC wanted his name cleared before he resumed playing cricket. In late September, Butt filed an appeal to the ICC asking them to lift his temporary suspension. After Mohammad Asif had dropped his appeal against the charges so that he could understand the charges filed against him, Butt said he was determined to prove his innocence and that his appeal was going to go ahead.In an interview with the Associated Press, Butt stated \"I do not want to comment on The News of the World because everybody knows what kind of paper it is. Everybody knows about its reputation across the world.\" He also stated that he was linked to Mazhar Majeed as a player agent but not in any spot-fixing. He also stated that the video can easily be edited and modified and manipulated. One day before the hearing, Butt continued to state his innocence. The tribunal announced that a verdict on the decision had been deferred to 5 February 2011 and that the ICC also stated that the tribunal would rule on charges pertaining to the third Test match between England and Pakistan. Butt was the only player before the tribunal to face these additional charges.On 5 February 2011, the three-man tribunal delivered its verdict. One charge was dismissed against Butt from the third Test match (batting out a maiden over), but the other charges (failing to report an advance from the third Test match and ordering Asif and Amir to bowl no-balls in the fourth Test) were proved, and Butt was banned from the sport of cricket for ten years, five of which were suspended should he not commit any further offences and participate in a Pakistani Cricket Board anti-corruption program.\n\n\n=== Return to domestic cricket ===\nIn January 2016, the PCB allowed Butt to play in the National One Day Cup, in which he played for WAPDA and scored 536 in 7 matches at an average of 107, ending up one of the leading run-scorers in the tournament. He was the man of the match in the final of the 2016\u201317 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, scoring a century in both innings. WAPDA won the title. During the 2017\u201318 National T20 Cup he jointly with Kamran Akmal set the world record opening partnership in T20 history of unbeaten 209 runstand, surpassing the previous highest opening partnership of 207 in any form of T20 cricket held by Joe Denly and Daniel Bell-Drummond. The record runstand was also the third highest partnership in terms of runs for any wicket in T20 history.In April 2018, he was named in Sindh's squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. He was the leading run-scorer in the 2018\u201319 Quaid-e-Azam One Day Cup, with 559 runs in ten matches. He was also the leading run-scorer for Water and Power Development Authority in the 2018\u201319 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 610 runs in ten matches. In March 2019, he was named as the captain of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's squad for the 2019 Pakistan Cup.In September 2019, he was named in Central Punjab's squad for the 2019\u201320 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy tournament. In September 2020, Butt refused to take part in the 2020\u201321 National T20 Cup, after he was demoted from the team's first XI.In October 2020, Butt withdrew his name from Quaid-e-Azam Trophy to explore a future in a non-playing role in the game. Reportedly, PCB has offered him a commentator's role for the broadcast of the first-class tournament.In June 2021, Salman Butt joined the PCB\u2019s umpiring and match referee phase 1 course.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nAn accumulator, Butt works hard for his runs, not indulging in too many big hits; his statistics show the low number of 19 international sixes to date (1 September 2010) of which he's scored 10 in Twenty20 cricket, 7 in One-Day Internationals and only six in Test cricket. He scores a lot of his runs between backward point and extra cover. He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using the pace of the ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is best to keep the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to third man if there are no slips, especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots. However, many commentators have expressed that his defensive technique has flaws, and that he is prone to playing at balls outside off-stump which should be left.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSalman Butt at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Martin van Jaarsveld (born 18 June 1974) is a former South African cricketer who played nine Tests and eleven One Day Internationals for South Africa between 2002 and 2004. Van Jaarsveld is a specialist middle-order batsman, though he has two wickets in One Day International cricket, including England opening batsman Marcus Trescothick in a match where he bowled five overs for 18 runs, but did not get to bat because of a 153-run partnership between Jacques Kallis and Jacques Rudolph.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe got his international debut following his performances in the 2001\u201302 season, where he made 1,268 runs at a batting average of 74.58, beginning his international career with the home series against Bangladesh in 2002\u201303, though in a ten-wicket win at Benoni, he made no contribution with bat or ball. He top-scored in the next match, however, making 42, and also dismissed Talha Jubair with his first ball in international cricket to end the innings. In the two Tests, he made 50 runs in two innings, and was dismissed once, lbw to Tapash Baisya.\nHowever, after scoring three runs against Sri Lanka in the first match of a two-Test series, he was left out as Herschelle Gibbs recovered from a back injury, and only returned for the 2003 NatWest Series. South Africa finished second at the three-team tournament, but van Jaarsveld only passed 20 once, ending with 82 runs at an average of 20.50, and he was left out of the squad to tour Pakistan in 2003\u201304. He played two Tests in that season, making a maiden Test half-century with 73 against West Indies after Gary Kirsten pulled out, and replacing Neil McKenzie for the final Test in New Zealand, making 59 and 13 not out in a nine-wicket win.\nVan Jaarsveld also went on tour to Sri Lanka in 2004, but despite a first-innings 51 in the second Test, South Africa lost that match by 313 runs to lose the series. However, he was given one last chance in the One Day International team at the 2004 Champions Trophy, replacing Jean-Paul Duminy after a 0\u20135 ODI-series loss in Sri Lanka. After not batting against Bangladesh, van Jaarsveld made a golden duck in South Africa's second and last match, smashing a ball from Ian Bradshaw to Daren Powell in a five-wicket loss to the eventual champions West Indies. He played two more Tests, however \u2013 making 15 runs in two innings (out of the South Africans' total of 679) in a draw at Green Park Stadium, Kanpur before he was dropped for Hashim Amla. He came back for the second Test of five against England, but a first-innings 1 did not impress the selectors, though he did make 49 off 52 balls in the second innings as South Africa attempted a chase of 378 in 86 overs.\n\n\n== Kolpak deal and international retirement ==\nIn 2005, van Jaarsveld retired from international cricket, choosing instead to become a Kolpak player in English county cricket for Kent. Van Jaarsveld claimed that he was making \"a decision about what [was] best for [his] long-term future\". He made the highest score for Kent in the 2005 season, with 262 not out against Glamorgan, but was third in the run-scoring tables with 1,198 runs, behind former England Test player Robert Key and 29-year-old Darren Stevens. He returned to South African domestic cricket for the 2005\u201306 season, playing for the Benoni Titans and making 211 runs in five SuperSport Series games at an average lower than five other Titans players.\n\n\n== References ==\nMartin van Jaarsveld at ESPNcricinfo\nWisden Cricketer's Almanack 2003\nBatsman Van Jaarsveld joins Kent from BBC"

        "article": "Dwayne Romel Smith (born 12 April 1983) is a  former Barbadian international cricketer who has represented the West Indies in all three formats of the game. An all-rounder, he is known as an aggressive and powerful right-handed batsman, bowls medium pace, and is also an athletic fielder.\nSmith has played for Barbados since the start of his career but has also played three seasons for Sussex from 2008 to 2010. He has become a sought-after Twenty20 player, making appearances in the Indian Premier League, for the Chennai Super Kings Mumbai Indians and the Deccan Chargers, and for New South Wales in the Australian domestic competition and  for the  Bangladesh Premier League in  Khulna Royal Bengals for Pakistan Super League in Islamabad United. On 1 March 2017, Smith announced his retirement from all international cricket.Smith has the record for scoring the most ducks in T20 cricket history (27).\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nSmith made his first-class debut for Barbados in January 2002 in a Busta Cup match against Guyana. He did not bowl in the match but made scores of 10 and 35, his second innings ended after he was out hit wicket, an unusual form of dismissal. In his fifth match of the season, against the Leeward Islands, there were two notable occasions for Smith; he took his first wicket and, with an innings of 102, scored his first century. He finished the season with a batting average of 21.36.In the 2002\u201303 season his bowling was used more often, he took seven wickets at an average of 28.42. His batting average improved to 24.55 but he was not able to score a half century during the season. Barbados finished as tournament winners but Smith did not feature in the final. It was not until October 2003 that Smith played his first List-A match, scoring a duck on his debut against Antigua and Barbuda in the 2003\u201304 Red Stripe Bowl. However, his form improved and he finished the season with a batting average of 39.75 and a highest score of 92 not out.\n\n\n=== Indian Premier League ===\nIn 2008 Smith was added to the Mumbai Indians squad during the inaugural IPL season, he replaced his national teammate Dwayne Bravo. He played four games during the season and was most notable for his bowling; he took 5 wickets at an average of 16.60.In the following edition of the IPL Smith was bought at the player auction for US$100,000 by the Deccan Chargers. His batting was a lot more successful than his bowling on this occasion; he scored 215 runs at an average of 26.87 compared with 1 wicket at an average of 124.00. Deccan Chargers won the tournament but Smith did not appear in the knock-out stages. He was retained by the Deccan chargers for the 2010 season but only played three matches.\nIn 2012, he was signed by the Mumbai Indians as a replacement player for the injured Mitchell Johnson.\nOn 6 May 2012, he played a vital role in the win of Mumbai Indians against Chennai Super Kings, when he hit Ben Hilfenhaus to the fence thrice in a row \u2013 a 6, followed by two consecutive 4s, when 14 runs were required off the last three balls.In 2014, Smith was bought by Chennai Super Kings for Rs. 42,500,000.\n\n\n=== Pakistan Super League ===\nSmith was bought for disclosed amount by Islamabad United he made his debut in 2016 season. Smith joined the side when half of team's matches were played. In the Final of 2016 season Smith won the Man of the Match award after he took United to title victory by scoring 73 from 51 balls.\nHe was retained by United at 2017 Pakistan Super League players draft. He was the leading run scorer for his side scoring 274 runs in 9 matches he played.\n\n\n=== County cricket ===\nSmith has spent three seasons playing for the English County side Sussex. He originally signed for Sussex on a short-term deal for their 2008 Twenty20 Cup season. After impressive performances, in particular a highest score of 72 not out against Hampshire, he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal as a Kolpak player. That season Smith also played in for Sussex in the Pro40. He played seven of the eight matches, helping Sussex to the Division one title.Smith played a much greater role in the following season for Sussex, making appearances in all four domestic competitions. Sussex reached two finals in the season, the first of which, the Friends Provident Trophy they lost to Hampshire with Smith scoring 20. The next final was to be more successful for Smith as Sussex beat Somerset in the Twenty20 Cup earning the man of the match award with his innings of 59. More success came for Sussex and Smith that season when they again won the Pro40, he averaged 35.16 with the bat and 15.88 with the ball. He also took a hat-trick in a game against Nottinghamshire. Although they were successful in the one-day formats, they were relegated from Division one of the County Championship. Because of their victory in the Twenty20 Cup, Sussex qualified for the Champions League. Smith decided to play for Sussex rather than his IPL team, the Deccan Chargers, who had also qualified for the tournament. Sussex were eliminated after finishing last in the group stage.He returned to Sussex to play in the Friends Life t20 in 2010 as an overseas player after his Kolpak status had expired.\n\n\n=== New South Wales ===\nSmith was signed by New South Wales for the 2009\u201310 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. He played all five matches in the group stage as New South Wales finished fourth and did not proceed to the final. Although his batting was disappointing, 31 runs at 7.75, he took 6 wickets at an average of 17.50.\n\n\n=== Other T20 franchise cricket ===\nFor his performances in 2013, he was named in the Cricinfo CLT20 XI.In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== International breakthrough ===\nFollowing the 2002\u201303 Red Stripe Bowl, Smith was included in the West Indies squad to tour South Africa. He made his Test debut in the third match of the series. After scoring 20 in the first innings, Smith helped the West Indies to save the game in the second as he made 105 not out on the final day to become the eleventh West Indian to score a hundred on Test debut. Smith played nine more Tests for the West Indies over the next two years without excelling with bat or ball, his debut hundred remains the only time he has passed 50 in a Test innings. During the tour he also made his ODI debut. He played all five matches of the series and finished with a disappointing average of 12.33.\n\n\n=== ODI regular (2004\u20132007) ===\nAfter playing all five matches of the ODI series against England in April/May 2004, averaging 29.25 with the bat, Smith took part in his most successful ODI series yet, against the touring Bangladesh team. Smith won two-man of the match awards to help the West Indies win the series 3\u20130. The first was achieved after an innings of 62 not out in the second match at Kingstown followed by an all-round display at St George's where he took 3/24 in addition to scoring 23.Later in the year Smith endured a disastrous tour of England. After a poor performance in the triangular ODI tournament (also involving New Zealand), where he averaged 4.20 with the bat and 56.33 with the ball, he was forced to return home after injuring his shoulder in the final Test. The injury ruled him out of that year's Champions Trophy and he did not play another international match until May 2005.\nIn his return to the side he played all five matches of the home ODI series against South Africa. His performance was poor, in particular his bowling, he took one wicket for 135 runs. He had more success in the Indian Oil Cup later in the year, playing against India and hosts, Sri Lanka. The West Indies failed to qualify for the final but Smith finished the tournament with respectable averages of 31.75 with the bat and 40.00 with the ball.In the early 2006 tour against New Zealand, Smith made his biggest bowling contribution yet to the West Indies team, taking 9 wickets at an impressive average of 24.33. His wicket tally included innings figures of 5/45, which earned him the man of the match award at Eden Park and remains his best ODI bowling figures. Smith made his Twenty20 International debut during the tour, scoring 9 runs and taking 2 wickets in a tied match.\n\n\n=== Champions Trophy and World Cup ===\nAfter featuring in home series against Zimbabwe and India, and the DLF Cup (a triangular tournament played in Malaysia that also included Australia and India), Smith was included in the West Indies squad for the 2006 Champions Trophy. Although the West Indies, who were defending the title they won in 2004, reached the final, Smith made little contribution with bat or ball. After taking only two wickets and scoring eight runs over five matches played during the tournament, he was not included in the final against Australia.\n\n\n=== Return to international cricket ===\nSmith ended a gap of nearly two and a half years out of the West Indies side when he was called up to the squad for the ODI and T20I series in Australia in early 2010. Although Smith performed well, averaging 43.33 with the bat and 32.71 with the ball, the West Indies were soundly beaten 4\u20130 in the ODI series. After playing two matches against Zimbabwe following the tour of Australia, Smith again found himself out of the side. He was recalled for the Twenty20 series against England in September 2011.\n\n\n== Post retirement ==\nAfter retiring from international cricket, Dwayne Smith went onto participate in the second edition of the 2017 Hong Kong T20 Blitz and he became the first player as well as first overseas player to score a century in Hong Kong T20 Blitz.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="

He is the nephew of former South African captain and cricket chief Ali Bacher.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBacher entered South African cricket in 1995/96 in the Under-24 side which toured Sri Lanka and made his Test debut against India at the back end of the following year. Having had a mostly unsuccessful start to the season, his form picked up in Australia where he put in an innings of 96. He continued to impress for the next two years, but after poor form against England and the West Indies, he spent seven years out of one day cricket. He is best remembered for a spectacular catch he took while fielding deep to remove Sachin Tendulkar in the 1996 test series against India.\nBacher was picked once again in 2005 for an English One Day International, but he only played the first game of the one day series, and was dropped thereafter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdam Bacher at ESPNcricinfo\nAdam Bacher at the Commonwealth Games Federation"

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler. Lokuhittege had captained Colombo's Asoka Vidalaya from Under-13s to senior level. In January 2021, he was found guilty of three offences under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. As a result, he was banned from all cricket for eight years.\n\n\n== Fixing allegations ==\n\nDilhara Lokuhettige was suspected by Al Jazeera along with Jeevantha Kulatunga for being involved in match fixing during a fake T20 series in the United Arab Emirates.The Al Jazeera's Investigation Unit also revealed that former Pakistani cricketer Hasan Raza, Jeevantha Kulatunga and Dilhara Lokuhettige were preparing to make money by organising and arranging a fake tournament in the UAE solely to make huge collection of money to fix matches in the future.\n\n\n== International career ==\nWhen he was first picked for the Indian Oil Cup in 2005, there was relative shock, as Lokuhettige was picked practically out of obscurity after moderate domestic performances. However, he proved a quality acquisition, capturing both good batting and bowling statistics.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nHis big break came when he joined Bloomfield and met Ruchira Palliyaguru in 1999, who recommended him to the cricketing academy. He has Twenty-20 cricket since 2004 and was picked for the national team for the first time in July 2005. He made his Twenty20 debut on 17 August 2004, for Moors Sports Club in the 2004 SLC Twenty20 Tournament.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\nLokuhettige announced his retirement from Tests and ODIs on 24 September 2016. He criticized captain Angelo Mathews by stating that he cannot enter to the squad until Mathews playing for the team.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDilhara Lokuhettige at ESPNcricinfo"

He is a right handed top-order batsman, who is strong on the back-foot, as well as being a good cutter and puller of the ball.\n\n\n== International career ==\nBorn in Rhodesia, Goodwin attended St. John's College (Harare) before he emigrated to Australia as a teenager. He moved back to Zimbabwe, and represented his country for two years between 1998 and 2000. His wife had trouble settling in Zimbabwe, and so, after the Zimbabwe tour of England in 2000, they moved back to Australia. Murray Goodwin now resides in southwest Western Australia with his family. \nGoodwin and Grant Flower set the record for the highest 5th wicket runstand for Zimbabwe in ODI cricket (186*).\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nAfter his retirement from international cricket, he became a regular for the Western Warriors in Australia and for Sussex in England. He made 1,183 runs for Western Australia in 2003\u201304 and highlighted his consistency with 840 the following season. He has also played for the Netherlands as an overseas player.\nGoodwin holds the Sussex record for the highest individual innings, with 344* against Somerset in 2009, beating his own record of 335* set in 2003. Goodwin's 2003 innings helped Sussex to win their first-ever Championship title, after 164 years. He is also the only Sussex batsman to have twice made a double century and a century in the same match.Goodwin led Sussex to the league title in the final match of the 2008 NatWest Pro40 competition. After the collapse of Sussex's top and middle order against Nottinghamshire CCC, his 87 not out from 64 balls steered Sussex to victory. Needing three runs from Charlie Shreck's final delivery to tie the match and ensure victory for Sussex in the league table, Goodwin hit a six over long-on to clinch the game.Goodwin was released by Sussex County Cricket Club in August 2012, but was soon snapped up by Glamorgan, with whom he signed an initial 1-year contract on 17 October, 2012. In his first season with Glamorgan, Goodwin averaged over 56 with the bat in the County Championship, this triggered a year extension to his contract.\n\n\n== Career best performances ==\nas of 18 October 2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMurray Goodwin at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Warushavithana Upul Tharanga (born 2 February 1985), commonly known as Upul Tharanga (Sinhala: \u0d8b\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dad\u0dbb\u0d82\u0d9c), is a former professional Sri Lankan cricketer, and a former limited over captain who played for all formats of the game. He is a left-handed opening batsman and occasional wicket-keeper. On 23 February 2021, Upul announced his retirement from international cricket.\n\n\n== Early and domestic career ==\nBorn on 2 February 1985 as the youngest of the family, Tharanga was born at Balapitiya General Hospital. His father Warushavithanage Bhadrasoma was a fish market dealer. His mother R.J Padma is a housewife and Tharanga has one elder brother Nuwan Tharanga and one elder sister Kumesha Manori. Though his brother used to enjoy swimming, Tharanga chose cricket at the younger age. He first attended Devananda College, Ambalangoda, and passed grade 5 scholarship in 1995. Since then, Tharanga had his secondary education at Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda until ordinary level. However, with many cricket tours, he could not complete education towards advanced level. He started his cricket career as a teenager at his school.\nHaving played for Nondescripts since the age of 15, he played for Sri Lanka's under-15, under-17 and under-19 squads. He had a successful under-19 World Cup in 2004 with successful innings of 117 and 61 in successive games. He was sent by the Sri Lankan cricketing board to play league cricket for Loughton Cricket Club in Essex.\nTharanga's Sri Lankan call-up occurred in July 2005 when Sri Lanka was devastated, and after his family home was washed away by the 2004 Tsunami tragedy, where only the foundation of the house was left. His equipment, which was also washed away, was replaced by Kumar Sangakkara. Tharanga graduated to the \"A\" team and in July he was selected for the full squad.\nIn March 2018, he was named in Galle's squad for the 2017\u201318 Super Four Provincial Tournament. The following month, he was also named as the captain of Galle's squad for the 2018 Super Provincial One Day Tournament. He was the leading run-scorer in the tournament, with 396 runs in six matches.In August 2018, he was named as Colombo's vice-captain for the 2018 SLC T20 League. In the opening match of the tournament, he scored 124 not out, with Colombo going on to beat Galle by 90 runs. He was the leading run-scorer for the tournament, finishing with 414 runs in six matches, including another unbeaten century in the final.In March 2019, he was named in Colombo's squad for the 2019 Super Provincial One Day Tournament. In October 2020, he was drafted by the Dambulla Hawks for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League.\n\n\n== International career ==\nOn the 2006 tour of England he really began to develop, particularly in the one-day game, scoring over 300 runs in Sri Lanka's 5\u20130 whitewash of the hosts. In addition, Tharanga is also well known for taking part in a record-breaking first wicket partnership with Sanath Jayasuriya in the final match of this series. He finished off with 109 off 102 balls, and played a pivotal role in completing the whitewash against England in England for the first time.Tharanga lost his form in the 2007 World Cup scoring only one half century (against New Zealand) he then continued his poor run of form in the home series against England in 2007 where he failed to contribute and often fell before the 10th over often resulting in a middle-order collapse. Subsequently, he lost his ODI place to Malinda Warnapura and his test place to Michael Vandort but he remains within the squad.However, in the 2011 World Cup, he is back to performing remarkably. In the quarter-final game against England, his partnership with Tillakaratne Dilshan, wrapped up the game, each acquiring centuries. His strong form has returned him to the opening position in the strong Sri-Lankan batting line up. He has also come in for special praise from Jayasuriya, one of the legends of cricket, saying that he could be the next captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team.\n\n\n=== Through ranks ===\nTharanga is the second batsman in the world who was involved with 7 times 200+ partnerships in ODI cricket after Ricky Ponting.\nOn 2 July 2013, Upul Tharanga scored the second highest ODI score of 174* by a Sri Lankan only behind Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 189 against India. With that innings he became the 9th Sri Lankan player to pass 5000 runs margin. Despite his low match participation, he has earned 15 centuries and 12 man of the match titles for his name throughout his international career.Tharanga is the fastest Sri Lankan to reach 4000 ODI runs, reached by 119 innings.\n\n\n=== Test career ===\nAfter 8 years of scarcity for Test cricket, Tharanga was called to the third Test match against Pakistan on 3 July 2015. He was used as the replacement for Kumar Sangakkara who did play for first two Tests, but not to third Test at Kandy, due to his retirement consideration during India tour. He scored 46 runs in the first innings and 48 in the second innings. However, Sri Lanka lost the series by 2\u20131.Tharanga holds the record of waiting for Maximum number of days between two test centuries. Since World War-2 it is the longest gaps between Test centuries by a player.\n\n\n=== Limited over comeback ===\nTharanga, who had a long ODI scarcity, was included to the ODI squad against Pakistan. Due to the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, the number three position had a vacant and Sri Lanka cricket selected Tharanga for the crucial number three position in ODIs.\n\n\n=== Captaincy ===\nDue to multiple injuries of usual captain Angelo Mathews, Tharanga was selected as Sri Lankan captain, to lead them in ODI tri series in Zimbabwe on 5 November 2016. On 14 November 2016, he led Sri Lankan team for the first time in an ODI against Zimbabwe, which was won comfortably by 8 wickets. At the end, Sri Lanka won the tri-series by defeating the hosts Zimbabwe in the final by 6 wickets. Tharanga was also the 19th captain for Sri Lanka in ODIs.Tharanga was selected again as the ODI captain for the South Africa series, when Mathews was not available after he sustained an injury during the second T20I. However, South Africa outplayed in all 5 ODIs and whitewashed Sri Lanka for the first time.On 9 February 2017, Tharanga was named as the T20I captain for Sri Lanka during the 3-T20I tour for Australia, where stand-in captain Dinesh Chandimal was ruled out from the tour due to poor performances. Tharanga was also the 8th captain for Sri Lanka in T20Is. Under Upul Tharanga's captaincy,Sri Lanka went on to win the T20I series against Australia in Australia,which means this was the record 3rd consecutive time Sri Lanka managed to win the T20I series against Australia in Australia.On 28 March 2017, he played in his 200th ODI match, when Sri Lanka played Bangladesh. In the match he scored his 31st fifty, but finally match ended in no result due to heavy rain.With the calf injury of Mathews prior to 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, Tharanga was named stand-in captain for the first group match against South Africa. However, Sri Lanka lost the match by 96 runs and due to slow over rate, Tharanga was fined with two matches after four-hour innings and disqualified for rest of the pool games against India and Pakistan.Though he was appointed several times as the captain, it was only temporary due to the injury concerns of captain Mathews. However, after the major loss to Zimbabwe in home soil for the first time, Mathews' captaincy was questioned by many critics. The result was, Mathews stepped down from the role in all formats on 11 July 2017. With that, Tharanga was named permanent captain of the limited over formats for Sri Lanka.Tharanga lead Sri Lanka on day 4 in the first test against India on 28 July 2017, where stand-in captain Rangana Herath was injured while playing in the match. However, Sri Lanka lost the match by 304 runs, which is the biggest loss by Sri Lanka in term of runs in tests as well. In the second ODI against India on 24 August 2017, Tharanga was penalized for slow over-rate, and suspended for two ODIs. This was his second time in three months that penalized due to slow over rate as well.On 16 October 2017, Tharanga became the first batsman for Sri Lanka, and the first captain overall, to carry his bat in an ODI.Under Upul Tharanga captaincy, Sri Lanka suffered three 5-0 whitewashes in the year 2017. Apart from suffering whitewashes at the hands of South Africa, India and Pakistan in 2017, that threatened automatic qualification for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, Tharanga also got into trouble twice due to slow over rates and was suspended.\nOn 29 November 2017, Sri Lanka Cricket sacked Tharanga from captaincy and Thisara Perera was named as Sri Lanka's captain for the ODI and T20I matches against India. Under Tharanga's captaincy, Sri Lanka suffered three 5-0 ODI whitewashes in the year 2017 against South Africa, India and Pakistan. His win/loss ratio is 4/15.In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n\n== Doping violation ==\nA urine sample provided by Tharanga after the world cup semi-final against New Zealand on 29 March 2011 was found to have metabolites of two glucocorticosteroids \u2013 prednisone and prednisolone, which are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Tharanga initially claimed he had taken some medication for asthma and had no idea it was a banned drug.An independent anti-doping tribunal was convened at which Tharanga pleaded guilty, claiming he had taken some herbal remedy to ease discomfort caused by a long-standing shoulder injury. The tribunal accepted that Tharanga \"had no intention to enhance his sporting performance or to mask the use of another performance enhancing substance, but that he had failed to satisfy the high levels of personal responsibility implicit upon him as an international cricketer subject to anti-doping rules\". The tribunal found Tharanga guilty of breaching the ICC Anti-Doping Code and banned him from all cricket and cricket-related activities for a three-month period (9 May 2011 to 8 August 2011).\n\n\n== International centuries ==\nIn his third Test match he scored his first Test Century in Shaheed Chandu Stadium, Bogra. Tharanga made his ODI debut against West Indies in 2005. He scored his first ODI century back in 2005 against Bangladesh scoring 105 in R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. His highest ODI score came in 2013 against India where he scored 174 Not out at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica. It's the second highest score by Sri Lankan in ODI after Sanath Jayasuriya's 189. As of 6 May 2017 Tharanga has scored three Test centuries and 15 ODI centuries.\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Marvin Ivan \"Buck\" Barrow (March 14, 1903 \u2013 July 29, 1933) was a member of the Barrow Gang. He was the older brother of  the gang's leader, Clyde Barrow. He and his wife, Blanche, were wounded in a gun battle with police four months after they joined up with Bonnie and Clyde. Buck died of his injuries soon afterwards.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMarvin Ivan \"Buck\" Barrow was born in Jones Prairie, Marion County, Texas, the third child of Henry and Cumie Barrow. An aunt, watching the little boy \"running around acting like a horse,\" gave him the nickname Buck. He ceased attending school around age 8 or 9, and enjoyed fishing and hunting instead.\nIn the early 1920s the older Barrow children left the family farm one by one, to marry and start careers in Dallas. At 18 or 19 Buck too went to Dallas, ostensibly to work for his brother repairing cars, but he quickly became part of the West Dallas petty-criminal underworld. His sister Marie, barely school age when she and her parents moved to the West Dallas campground, remembered watching him put spurs on roosters for cockfighting, and his pit bull, which tore off the back of her dress. He married twice and divorced twice during this time, and had three children by those marriages. Just before Christmas 1926 Buck, 23, and Clyde, 17, were arrested with a truck full of stolen turkeys they intended to sell for the holidays. Buck took the rap for himself and his brother and went to jail for a week, but the turkey adventure was an ironic joke, as by now Buck was making ends meet by stealing automobiles in cities all over Texas and selling them for a comfortable $100 or so to fences out of state.\nOn November 11, 1929, Barrow met Blanche Caldwell in an unincorporated part of Dallas County called West Dallas. They fell in love almost immediately.\nOn November 29, 1929, several days after meeting Blanche, Barrow was shot and captured following a burglary in Denton, Texas. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to four years in the Texas State Prison System. On March 8, 1930, however, Barrow escaped from the Ferguson Prison Farm near Midway, Texas. He simply walked out of the prison, stole a guard's car, and drove to his parents' place in West Dallas where Blanche was living.\nIn interviews with author/historian John Neal Phillips, Blanche was frank about the fact that she not only knew of Buck's escape, but that she hid with him and actually staged robberies with him.  The notion that Blanche did not know until later that Buck was an escaped convict was fabricated by the Barrow family and Blanche herself as a means of convincing Missouri State authorities to reduce her prison sentence following her capture in July 1933.\nOn July 3, 1931, Blanche and Buck were married in Oklahoma. Blanche was not interested in pursuing a criminal career. She and other members of the Barrow family convinced Buck to turn himself into Texas prison authorities and complete his sentence. Two days after Christmas 1931 his mother and his wife drove him to the gate of Huntsville penitentiary, where he told surprised prison officials that he had escaped almost two years before and needed to resume his sentence.  They welcomed him in.\nDuring his two years at Huntsville Buck sent repentant letters home, written for him by fellow prisoners. Before he had served two years of his six-year sentence he was abruptly pardoned, partly as part of Texas governor Ma Ferguson's plan to decrease prison crowding and partly due to the lobbying efforts of his wife and his mother.\nUpon his release, March 22, 1933, Buck Barrow, in the company of Blanche, joined his younger brother Clyde, Bonnie Parker, and W. D. Jones in Joplin, Missouri where he participated in several armed robberies.\n\n\n== Murders ==\nOn April 13, 1933, Buck, Clyde, and W. D. Jones participated in a shootout with law enforcement officers at Joplin, Missouri. Two officers, Newton County Constable Wes Harryman and Joplin City Motor Detective Harry McGinnis, were killed.\nOn June 23, 1933, Buck and W. D. Jones killed Alma, Arkansas City Marshal Henry D. Humphrey during a gunfight on the road between Alma and Fayetteville. Clyde Barrow was not involved in the Humphrey killing.\n\n\n== Platte City and Dexfield Park ==\nOn July 19, 1933, Buck was mortally wounded in the head by Capt. William Baxter of the Missouri Highway Patrol during a shootout at the Red Crown Tourist Court at Platte City, Missouri. The bullet opened up a large hole in Buck's forehead that exposed his brain and caused severe loss of blood. Blanche was also wounded in the same gunfight. She and her husband escaped, however, along with Bonnie, Clyde, and W. D. Jones. Despite his ghastly head wound, and loss of blood, Buck was sometimes fully conscious, and talked and ate.\nOn July 24, Buck, near death, was wounded six times in the back during a shootout near an abandoned amusement park between Redfield and Dexter, Iowa. Bonnie, Clyde, and W. D. Jones, all wounded in the same gunfight, escaped. Buck and Blanche, though, were captured.\nBlanche survived her wounds, although losing sight in one eye. Extradited to Missouri, she was tried for the attempted murder of Sheriff Holt Coffey at Platte City. She was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison.\n\n\n== Hospital ==\nBuck was taken to King's Daughters Hospital in Perry, Iowa. His doctors commented in their report on how clean Buck's head wound was, given the circumstances. Bonnie and Clyde had poured hydrogen peroxide into the head wound, cleaning it. On arrival Buck was generally lucid and told doctors that aspirin helped the pain in his head and the only real pain he felt was from his other gunshot wounds, particularly the one in his back. That bullet, doctors discovered, had entered his back, ricocheted off a rib and lodged in his chest wall close to the pleural cavity. Because he was in such a weakened state\u2014his limbs had grown paralyzed from another bullet wound and his temperature would not lower from 105\u2014his doctors expected he would develop pneumonia from the surgery on his chest. They predicted either that or infection of his brain from the head wound would kill him in a few days.Lawmen visited him in the hospital to get his final statements. Though doctors kept him numb with opiates, they also injected him with stimulants at least twice, so that he might answer questions. \"Due to the lack of medical attention,\" an interrogator noted, \"the wound in Barrow's head gave off such an offensive odor that it was with utmost difficulty that one could remain within several feet of him.\" He agreed with Deputy Red Salyers that he had shot and killed Marshal Humphrey in Arkansas. He was able to chat with the doctor, who asked him, \"Where are you wanted by the law?\" \"Wherever I've been,\" replied Buck.\n\n\n== Death ==\nWhen word of Buck's dire condition reached Texas, Dallas County Sheriff R.A.\"Smoot\" Schmid wrote a letter of introduction to the local authorities for Buck and Clyde's mother Cumie, and a deputy sheriff provided money to help cover her expenses in the 36-hour drive to Iowa. She and her youngest son LC arrived for Buck's last conscious days. As his pneumonia became more serious, he became delirious and finally slipped into a coma, from which he did not wake. He died at 2pm on Saturday, July 29, 1933.\nHenry and Cumie Barrow delayed buying a gravestone for Buck. They were sure Clyde would follow him into death any day, and whether for practical or loving reasons or a mix of both, decided to wait for Clyde. Clyde liked the idea and suggested the epitaph to go over himself and his brother: \"Gone But Not Forgotten.\"On Buck and Clyde's shared gravestone, Buck's year of birth is incorrect. His mother gave the stonecutters their sister Nell's birth year for him. However, she had recorded the birth dates of all her children in the family Bible; there, Buck's birth date is 1903.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBarrow, Blanche Caldwell, edited by John Neal Phillips (2004).

        "article": "Anthony John Ireland (born 30 August 1984) is a former cricketer from Zimbabwe. A fast bowler, he performed consistently during his tenure with Zimbabwe, taking 38 wickets in 26 matches at an average of 29.34. He was one of many talented white Zimbabweans to leave the team due to the situation of the ZCU and the country, to pursue careers in English domestic cricket, where he represented Gloucestershire and Middlesex before joining Leicestershire for the 2013 season, retiring from professional cricket at the end of the 2014 season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIreland made his ODI debut against New Zealand at Bulawayo on 24 August 2005 where he took the wickets of both Stephen Fleming and Chris Cairns. He performed consistently with the ball, being one of the few prospects on the Zimbabwe team, after the exodus of players like Gavin Ewing, Andy Blignaut, Henry Olonga, Andy Flower and Tatenda Taibu. However, even with his performances Zimbabwe cricket continued on its downturn, as they gradually became weaker and weaker as an international side.\nHe toured the West Indies with the Zimbabwean team but broke his left hand in practice. Although he recovered, he struggled to adapt to the West Indian conditions, as Zimbabwe were thrashed 5-0 by the hosts. \nA regular member of the side in 2006, he was selected in the 2007 Cricket World Cup squad and returned to the Caribbean, taking a wicket in each of his games.\nZimbabwe was at an all-time low at this point in time, and Ireland, soon after Zimbabwe were eliminated from the 2007 Cricket World Cup, retired from international cricket, explaining that he felt he was wasting his talents for a poor side in a country in political turmoil, and felt that he should pursue his cricket elsewhere.\n\n\n== Cricket in England ==\nPlaying in the United Kingdom, Ireland enjoyed a successful season in 2004 for club teams Belvoir CC and Belton Park CC, before returning to Zimbabwe. He played for the PCA Masters against Gloucestershire in a game before the England vs Pakistan Twenty20 international, at Bristol. He has since played for Thornbury Cricket Club in the south west of England.\nRetiring from international cricket after the 2007 World Cup, he signed a two-year deal with Gloucestershire under the Kolpak agreement. With Gloucestershire, he has had a number of significant impacts with the ball, taking 7/36 against Leicestershire, and match figures of 7/110 against the same side. He was a regular in the Gloucestershire team, along with the likes of Jon Lewis and Steve Kirby. He recently returned briefly to Zimbabwe to play in the Twenty/20 tournament for the Southern Rocks, taking 3 wickets in his only game.\nHe signed for Middlesex in 2010 in a contract that would take him to the end of the 2013 season. He was not able to gain a regular spot in the Middlesex team and returned to Gloucestershire on 20 August 2012.On 7 March 2013, Ireland won a one-year deal with Leicestershire. After the 2013 season, he was awarded a further season long contract. He was released by Leicestershire at the end of the 2014 season.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\nIreland retired in 2014 after being released by Leicestershire. He moved to New Zealand, and now works as a sales manager.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n5. Ireland penalised for beamer | Cricdb\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo profile"

In the 1996-97 season, he became only the third player to score over 1000 runs in a Ranji Trophy season. He played in six Ranji Trophy finals for Delhi scoring centuries in four of them, but only twice ended up on the winning side (1985\u201386 and 1991\u201392). Sharma also regularly represented North Zone in the Duleep Trophy.\n\n\n== International career ==\nDespite his domestic scoring record, Sharma only played one Test match for India - against the West Indies in January 1988. He played 31 One Day Internationals for India from 1988 to 1993.\nIn December 1988, he scored back-to-back fifties against New Zealand, but he did not reach those heights again except for a 59 not out (his highest ODI score) against Zimbabwe in March 1993. He finished with 424 runs at a batting average of 20.19. Sharma also took 15 wickets using his left-arm spin with a best of 3/41 against Australia in October 1989.\n\n\n== Life ban ==\nIn 2000, aged 36, his career ended when he received a life ban from cricket after he was implicated in a match-fixing scandal.In September 2014, Sharma  was cleared from all charges related to match-fixing by Delhi district court and has asked the BCCI to allow him to take part in the board's activities and those of its associates.He retired from active cricket and is now invested in running multiple franchises of laundry and dry-cleaning brand UClean in Delhi NCR and Punjab.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAjay Sharma at ESPNcricinfo"

He is currently also the head coach of the First XI and director at Guildford Grammar School in Perth, Western Australia\nAckerman has four Test appearances for South Africa all made in 1998. He made a gutsy 57 in his first Test innings but after that made little impact. It was thought that Ackerman had a weakness against top class spin as Mushtaq Ahmed and Muttiah Muralitharan were particularly successful against him in successive series.\nHe joined Leicestershire in 2005 under the Kolpak ruling which allowed him to play for an English county without being registered as an overseas player. He was the captain of Leicestershire in 2005, having some success in one-day cricket.\nIn the 2006 season, Ackerman stepped down to concentrate on his batting. This move seems to have paid off as Ackerman scored 309 not out against Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens, the highest ever first-class score by a Leicestershire player.\nAckerman's father, Hylton Michael Ackerman, played first-class cricket for Border, Natal, Northern Transvaal and Western Province in South Africa, and for Northamptonshire in England. He was picked for the World XI that played Australia in 1971-72, but did not play Test cricket because of South Africa's exclusion from international cricket on account of apartheid.\n\n\n== References ==\nHD Ackerman at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Morris William Sievers (13 April 1912, Powlett River, Victoria \u2013 10 May 1968, Brunswick, Victoria) was an Australian cricketer who played in three Tests in 1936\u201337.\n\n\n== First-class career ==\nSievers began his career in 1930 for the Colts, at 17 years of age.  Sievers was a useful right-handed lower order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Victoria in the seasons leading up to the Second World War. He made a lot of useful 50s for the state team, but his bowling was inclined to be expensive.\nSievers toured South Africa in 1935\u201336 with the Australian cricket team under Vic Richardson but, with the Australian bowling dominated by the spin of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly, he was not called on for any of the Tests and took only seven first-class wickets on the tour.\n\n\n== Test career ==\nSievers' Test match experience came in the first three matches of the MCC tour under Gubby Allen in 1936\u201337. Curiously fragile batting by the Australians gave England commanding victories in both the first two matches, at Brisbane and at Sydney, and Sievers distinguished himself with neither ball nor bat.\nThe third Test at Melbourne, however, saw a complete reversal of fortune, largely through the intervention of the weather. After Australia had struggled on the first day on a lifeless pitch, rain set in, so that when Donald Bradman declared at 200 for nine wickets and sent England in to bat, the pitch was of uncertain bounce, if any, and Sievers profited. When England declared having made just 76 for nine wickets, Sievers had taken five for 21, the best figures of the innings. Bradman then juggled his batting order to send expendable tail-enders in first and hit 270 himself on a by-now benevolent pitch. Australia won the match by 365 runs and went on to win the other two matches of the series to retain The Ashes.Sievers, though, was dropped from the English tour after his Melbourne effort and despite finishing at the top of the Australian bowling averages for the series, he never played Test cricket again.Sievers continued playing cricket until 1946, ending his career with an average just over 16 for his 270 First XI wickets.At the age of 56, he died from a heart attack in a hospital in Melbourne.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\nList of Victoria first-class cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\ncricketarchive.co.uk \nWisden 1937 and 1938 editions"

        "article": "Julien Mark Wiener (born 1 May 1955) is a former Australian cricketer who played in six Test matches and seven One Day Internationals in 1979 and 1980. A right-handed opening batsman and a very occasional off spin bowler, until Michael Klinger's debut he was the only known Jewish Australian to represent his country at cricket. A tall man, he was known for batting bare-headed showing his blonde hair.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWiener's mother and father, Bella and Sasha, were Polish and Austrian Jews respectively, and both escaped the concentration camps of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The surname Wiener came from Vienna, the home of Sasha. His parents married in 1947 in Paris, before coming to Australia as refugees on the famous Dunera ship in 1947.  Wiener's father ran a successful textile business, which allowed him to send Wiener to the private Brighton Grammar School. Wiener's father had early sporting success in table tennis, which Wiener applied to his cricket, playing for Prahran in Melbourne grade cricket. He subsequently completed his university education at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in business management, before moving to England to pursue his cricket career.He made a century on his first class debut for Victoria against Queensland in 1977\u201378, scoring 106. Two strong seasons, including three further centuries, saw Wiener selected to make is ODI debut as an opening batsman in December 1979 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against England and the West Indies. He struggled, scoring 7 and 27 respectively. Despite this he was selected to make his Test cricket debut against England at the WACA a few days later. He made 11 in the first innings before being run-out while batting with captain Greg Chappell, before scoring 58 in the second innings as Australia won the match. He played in four consecutive tests that summer (two each against England and the West Indies) before being omitted for the final test of the summer. Wiener played in five further ODIs in the Australian season, with his best performances being a 33 and 50 against the West Indies in Sydney in the final two group matches. Averaging only twenty, he was dropped from the ODI team for the finals and ended his ODI career with a slow strike rate of only 42.He was named to tour Pakistan in early 1980, and was recalled to the Test XI for the second and third tests in Faisalabad and Lahore. He made his highest score of 93 in the third test, but that turned out to be the last test of his career, as he was not selected for the national team again. He scored 281 runs at an average of 25.5 in his career.He, along with Jeff Moss had a partnership of 390 at the Junction Oval against Western Australia in 1981\u201382. This still stands as a record for the third wicket for Australians in first-class cricket. Wiener scored an unbeaten 221 in that innings, one of three centuries he produced in the season. Wiener played at the first-class level until retiring at the 1984/85 season, having scored seven centuries in 66 matches. He had also claimed 17 wickets with his off spin, although none of these came at national level.Wiener has worked in the corporate sector since leaving cricket.  He worked in sales for various companies, and formed his own consulting company in 2015.\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Graham Neil Edwards (27 May 1955 \u2013 6 April 2020) was a New Zealand cricketer. He played eight Test matches and six One Day Internationals for New Zealand.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nEdwards was born in Nelson, and attended Nelson College.He was a short, stocky wicketkeeper who was a good enough batsman to make his Test debut against Australia in 1976\u201377 as a specialist. He was brought back in 1977\u201378 as a wicketkeeper-batsman and made 55 and 54 on his comeback against England at Auckland. That won him selection for the England tour in 1978 where his performances were disappointing \u2013 one member of the BBC commentary team said that Edwards was \"the worst wicketkeeper I've ever seen ... he's made mistakes you'd have the 3rd XI 'keeper at school running round the pitch for\". But the genial Edwards kept his spirits up and was a popular tourist. He returned for three home Tests against India in 1980\u201381 where he chipped in with useful runs, but the emergence of Ian Smith signalled the end of his international career.\nEdwards played first-class and List A cricket for Central Districts from 1973-74 to 1984-85. His highest first-class score was 177 not out against Wellington in 1980-81, which was also his most successful season, with 812 runs at an average of 47.76. He was also a prominent player in the Hawke Cup for Nelson for many years, scoring 236 against North Canterbury in his last match, including six sixes and 29 fours.After retiring from cricket he ran a pub in Murchison, then worked as a gate-keeper at Port Nelson. He had several minor heart attacks before undergoing surgery for a triple bypass in 2007. He died on 6 April 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJock Edwards at CricketArchive (subscription required)\n\"Jock Edwards a leading big hitter\""

        "article": "Michael Klinger (born 4 July 1980) is an Australian former first-class cricketer, who held the record for the most runs scored in the Big Bash League when he retired in 2019.Until the 2008\u201309 season, Klinger played for Victoria and for St Kilda Cricket Club in Premier Cricket. He joined the South Australia Redbacks for the 2008\u201309 season, was named their Captain in 2010, and was recognised as the State Player of the Year in both 2009 and 2010. He was one of the 350 players under the hammer for the IPL Auction 2011, and was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala. In 2014 he was recruited by the Perth Scorchers and then also played for Western Australia. In March 2018, he announced his retirement from first-class cricket.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKlinger was born in Kew, Victoria, Australia, and is Jewish. He completed an undergraduate applied science degree and a Master of Business (Sport Management) degree at Deakin University.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Victoria ===\n\n\n==== Melbourne ====\nAs a young batsman, Klinger was named Captain of the Australia Under 19's Men's Cricket team \u2013 his deputy being Michael Clarke who subsequently became captain of the national team.Klinger began as an 18-year-old in the 1998\u201399 season. His career lowlight was the 2000\u201301 season when he made a famous 99 not out, with captain Paul Reiffel declaring the innings closed, a move which brought great controversy and remains the only batsman in Australian cricket to be stranded on 99 due to a declaration. This caused Klinger some great upset, and following it Klinger had several less successful years, but returned to contention for a spot in the Victorian Bushrangers side for the 2005\u201306 season. He quickly made his first first-class century, and then followed it up with his first List A one-day century, but his first-class form soon dropped, and he was replaced in the side by Lloyd Mash, not to return in the Pura Cup all season.  In 2003 he was the club professional for Walkden in the Bolton Cricket League.\nIn Season 2006\u201307 he started off in the outer from the Pura Cup side, but started off his Ford Ranger Cup season in style, nearly getting a century early on, and then following it up with one. He led the runs scoring in the competition for much of the season, eventually finishing 3rd. Klinger's rise to the Pura Cup team came only when Brad Hodge was called up by Australia for their ODI Series, and Klinger's recent form had been wavy, with his last game for the 2nd XI yielding a first innings duck, but second innings century. Klinger was soon to do the same for the 1st XI, but the century ensured that when Hodge returned, Klinger survived. He finished the season as a regular fixture of the Bushrangers side, and was part of a great partnership with David Hussey in a match against NSW, in which the Vics defied all odds to chase down a massive total of 360 on an extremely poor 4th day pitch (it was later described as a 3rd day pitch on day 1 by Hussey), scoring 102.\n\n\n=== South Australia ===\nKlinger joined the South Australia Redbacks for the 2008\u201309 season in order to get more opportunities at state level, where he began batting at number 3 rather than opening, and saw immediate success, scoring a maiden 150 not out against old state Victoria in his first game. Then, against Western Australia on 11 November, Klinger scored his maiden double century, finishing on 255, and he continued to score heavily in both the Sheffield Shield and the Ford Ranger Cup, and hit his third century for the season against Queensland at the Gabba, and his first away from the traditionally batting friendly Adelaide Oval.\nOn 11 December 2008, Klinger posted his highest individual score in one day cricket, with an unbeaten 133 off just 128 balls.  This guided South Australia to victory in their high-scoring match against the Tasmania Tigers at the Adelaide Oval. This was Klinger's fourth one-day century.

Kruger started his first-class cricket career in 1997\u201398 for Eastern Province B, moving up to the A team in 1999\u20132000. In 2003\u201304 he played for Gauteng, before moving to the Lions on the reorganisation of South African first-class cricket in 2004\u201305. Although he was called to the Test side in 2003\u201304, he did not make the final team. In 2005\u201306 he made his debut as an international cricketer, in the one-off Twenty20 International against Australia, and he also played in three One Day Internationals on the same tour.\nKruger represented English side Leicestershire in the 2007 and 2008 seasons as a Kolpak player and performed well in leading a young bowling attack. Kruger left the county at the end of the 2008 season claiming he was concerned about the workload of playing domestic cricket all year around. However, in December 2008 he signed for Glamorgan, becoming the county's first Kolpak player.In the past Kruger has been heavily critical of SA Cricket.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo page on Garnett Kruger\nCricketArchive page on Garnett Kruger"

        "article": "Edward Simon Hunter Giddins (born 20 July 1971) is a former English cricketer who played in four Tests from 1999 to 2000. \nGiddins was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, Giddins was educated at St. Bedes Preparatory School in Eastbourne where he first showed his talent for cricket whilst playing for the school team. Giddins played for four counties during his career \u2013 Sussex, Warwickshire, Surrey and Hampshire. He was banned from cricket for 18 months and dropped by Sussex after testing positive for cocaine in 1996.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nGiddins made his international debut against New Zealand at the Oval in August 1999, taking four wickets for 79 runs. Giddins' first Test match dismissal was former-Warwickshire batsman Roger Twose. New Zealand won this Test by 83 runs to clinch the four-game series 2\u20131.\n\n\n=== Zimbabwe ===\nGiddins was not selected for the winter tour of South Africa, but was back in the side for the two tests in England against Zimbabwe the following summer. England won the two-game series 1\u20130 and much of this is down to Giddins whose career best international figures of 5\u201315 in the first Zimbabwe innings helped swing the match in England's favour. Giddins also took two wickets in the second innings as well as scoring his highest score for England.The second Test finished as a draw, with Giddins getting figures of 1\u201346 and being the not out batsman in both England innings.\n\n\n=== West Indies ===\nGiddins was named in the team to face West Indies in the opening game the five match series of 2000. England lost this game by an innings and 93 runs and Giddins' figures of 0\u201373, as well as his only international pair, meant he was subsequently dropped from the side. This was to be his last appearance for the national side.\n\n\n== Poker career ==\nHe has turned to poker in early 2004. He managed to earn his living and even appeared on the poker chat show Heads Up with Richard Herring to discuss his career.\nGiddins has also appeared on the BBC reality TV show Arrange Me a Marriage.\nGiddins is currently, as of 2009, working for Sky Poker as an analyst.\nIn May 2011 Giddins starred in the second series of Channel 4s Celebrity Five Go To in which the celebrities visited South Africa.\nGiddins was voted the winner of the programme by the various people who looked after the celebrities during their stay.\nHis biggest poker cash so far is \u00a310,000, coming from famous UK festival.\nAs of June 2015, his total amount of cash is more than $82,375.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEd Giddins Hendon Mob poker tournament results\nEd Giddins RankingHero poker tournament results"

        "article": "Manfred Julius Susskind (8 June 1891 \u2013 9 July 1957) was a South African cricketer who played in five Tests in 1924. The first Jewish Test cricketer, he was born and died in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\n\n== Early cricket in England ==\nBorn in South Africa but educated in England at University College School and Cambridge University, Fred Susskind appeared in first-class cricket for Middlesex and Cambridge University as a right-handed middle-order batsman between 1909 and 1912 before returning to live in South Africa. He had little success in 16 matches in English cricket, with his only innings of more than 50 coming in his first game for Cambridge, when he scored 92 in the match against Surrey in 1910. He did not win a Blue for cricket during his time at Cambridge.\n\n\n== South African cricket ==\nReturning to South Africa, Susskind went into business: at his death in 1957 he was reported as having been a member of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange for more than 30 years. He also began playing cricket for Transvaal, and though not usually able to turn out for more than half the matches, he was successful for almost 20 years, and did not make his final appearance until the 1936\u201337 season. He hit his first century for Transvaal in his first season with the side, an innings of 136 against Eastern Province. Though war and irregular appearances over the next 10 years meant that this start was not followed up on, Susskind finally played a consecutive sequence of matches in the 1923\u201324 season and in one of these, against Border, he scored 171, which would be the highest of his career. That led to his selection for the trial match for the 1924 tour of England and with scores of 69 and 11 in the match, he gained a place in the touring party.\n\n\n== Test cricket in England ==\nThe 1924 South African tour of England was not successful in terms of winning Tests, with the five-match series lost 3\u20130 and the other two games ruined by rain. Susskind, however, did well if unspectacularly, playing in all five Tests and making four scores of more than 50. His style, however, attracted criticism. \"Though he scored so well, he did not command much admiration,\" wrote Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its review of the tour. It went on:\nConsidering his advantages in height and reach, he nearly always seemed cramped in style, only on rare occasions venturing to let himself go, and no one in the team was so constantly open to the charge of playing with his legs. This was especially noticeable when he was trying to save the Test match at Lord's, appeal after appeal against him for leg before wicket being made before at last the umpire gave him out.\n Susskind was omitted from the team for the first few matches, but when he finally appeared in the game against Gloucestershire towards the end of May, he made an unbeaten 69 and from then on he was the regular No 3 batsman in the side. In some matches, he also kept wicket, the South Africans having brought only one full-time wicketkeeper, Tommy Ward.\nThe Test series started disastrously for the South Africans, bundled out for just 30 in their first innings at Edgbaston by Arthur Gilligan and Maurice Tate. Having become the first Jewish Test cricketer, Susskind made 3 in his first Test innings, the only player to be dismissed with the assistance of a fielder, but improved on that with 51 in the second innings when South Africa totalled 390 but still lost by an innings. There was no such disaster in the second Test at Lord's, but the result was the same \u2013 an England victory by an innings, this time with the loss of only two wickets in the England innings. After the South Africans lost three wickets for 17 runs in the first innings, Susskind, with 64, put on 112 with Bob Catterall, who made 120, and in the second innings his 53 was the top score. Wisden noted that Susskind displayed \"endless patience, staying at the wickets for over two hours and a half\". The third Test was marginally less one-sided \u2013 South Africa followed on and lost by nine wickets \u2013 and Susskind was less successful personally, making 4 and 23. He failed again in the fourth match at Manchester, scoring just 5, but the match was restricted by rain to just two and three-quarters hours on the first day. The fifth and final Test at The Oval was also affected by rain and the first innings were not completed in a drawn match. Susskind made 65, his highest Test score and Wisden noted that he was \"patience personified\", and contrasted his \"steadiness\" to Catterall's \"brilliancy\": Susskind \"took three hours and forty minutes to get his invaluable 65,\" it said.In the other first-class matches on the tour, Susskind had an unspectacular record, scoring steadily across the summer but not making headlines until the tour was almost over. Then, in late matches, he hit 137 in the match against Surrey between the fourth and fifth Tests. And in a festival match at the end of the season between a team representing the South of England and the South Africans, he hit a second century, making 101 in 130 minutes. On the tour as a whole, he scored 1413 runs at an average of 33.63. The season in England also brought him the only three stumpings of his career and his only first-class wicket, Freddie Calthorpe in the match against Warwickshire.\n\n\n== Back to South Africa ==\nSusskind continued to play first-class cricket for Transvaal fairly regularly for the next eight South African seasons, though in some years he appeared in very few games. He did not take part in any further representative cricket and his best season was the 1931\u201332 season, when he was 40 and when many of the top South African players were on the tour to Australia and New Zealand. In that year, he scored four centuries and four other innings of between 50 and 99 in just seven matches, and he averaged 64.08 runs per innings in making 769 runs. That was pretty much his swansong, though he returned for two games in 1933\u201334 and for a final one in 1936\u201337, in which he scored 71 at the age of 45.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFred Susskind at ESPNcricinfo\nFred Susskind at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

Gordon became the oldest-ever Test cricketer on 23 March 2011, when he surpassed New Zealander Eric Tindill, who died on 1 August 2010, approximately four months before his 100th birthday.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGordon was Jewish, and was born in Boksburg, Transvaal.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nGordon played first-class cricket for Transvaal from 1933\u201334 as a right-handed fast bowler and a tail-end right-handed batsman.\nHe made his Test debut against England in December 1938, playing every Test of the five-match series. In the first Test, he took his best Test match figures of 7\u2013162, including 5\u2013103 in the first innings. He was stumped by Les Ames off the bowling of Tom Goddard for a first-ball duck in the drawn match. In the second match he took 5\u2013157 in England's only innings, but was again stumped by Ames off the bowling of Goddard for 0 in another drawn match.\nIn the third match, Gordon took 2\u2013127 in England's only innings and was out for 1 and 0, falling to Ken Farnes and Hedley Verity as England won by an innings and 13 runs. In the fourth match, he took 2\u201347 and 3\u201358 but did not bat in the drawn Test. In the final Test Gordon took match figures of 1\u2013256 and was not out in each innings, scoring 0 and 7. This match was the famous Timeless Test, which took 10 days and was eventually declared a draw by agreement between the teams. It was Gordon's final Test match.\nHe took his best innings figures of 6\u201361, followed by 3\u201386 in the second innings, for Transvaal against Natal at Johannesburg in 1939\u201340. He continued playing for Transvaal until the 1948\u201349 season.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nGordon ran a sports shop in central Johannesburg. He was the last living male to have played Test cricket before World War II. He turned 100 in August 2011 and lived in central Johannesburg. Following his death, he was succeeded as the oldest living first-class cricketer by John Manners.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\nList of oldest Test cricketers\nList of centenarians in sport\nList of South Africa cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorman Gordon at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Manoj Prabhakar pronunciation  (born 15 April 1963) is an Indian former cricketer. He was a right-arm medium-pace bowler and a lower-order batsman, and has also opened the innings sometimes for the Indian cricket team until his retirement in 1996.\nPrabhakar took 96 wickets in Test cricket, 157 wickets in One Day Internationals, and over 385 first class wickets playing for Delhi. He has also played for Durham. Prabhakar would always be remembered for his bowling which was his strongest suit; using slower balls, out swingers and opening the bowling for Indian cricket team. He was also a useful lower-order batsman and a defensive opener.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== As a Player ===\nPrabhakar quite regularly opened Indian batting order and the bowling, he was one of the few players to do so consistently at international level. He accomplished this 45 times in ODIs and 20 times in Tests, more than any other player in both formats.At the age of 32, Prabhakar played his last ODI against Sri Lanka in the 1996 Cricket World Cup in Delhi. He struggled to bowl well in the match and had to bowl off-spin in the last two overs. The crowd booed him off the ground. After 1996 World Cup, he was not selected for the Indian team's tour of England and took the retirement.\n\n\n=== As a Coach ===\nPrabhakar has also served as the Delhi cricket team's bowling coach and as the head coach of the Rajasthan cricket team. In November 2011, he was sacked as the coach of Delhi for speaking against the management and the team in media. In December 2015, he was named as bowling coach of Afghanistan cricket team ahead of 2016 ICC World Twenty20 that was played in India in March 2016.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 1999, Prabhakar participated in Tehelka's expose of match-fixing, but was himself charged of involvement and subsequently banned by the BCCI from playing cricket for Indian team. He was dismissed from his coaching role with the Delhi cricket team in 2011 after he publicly criticized the players and selectors.Prabhakar was accused for his slow century against West Indies along with Nayan Mongia's 21 ball 4\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrabhakar joined the Congress party and unsuccessfully contested election to the Indian Parliament from Delhi in 1996. Prabhakar is married to actress Farheen, who is known for her roles in the films Jaan Tere Naam and Kalaignan. The couple lives in Delhi, with their two sons, Raahil Prabhakar and Manavansh Prabhakar, and also Rohan Prabhakar, a son from previous marriage with Sandhya.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA Bollywood film Azhar released in 2016, directed by Tony D'Souza, was based on his teammate Mohammad Azharuddin life and revolves around Match fixing scandals in late 90s and 2000. Prabhakar's character was portrayed by Karanvir Sharma in the film. According to the report of The Times of India, Prabhakar was unhappy due to his depiction in bad light in the film.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nManoj Prabhakar at ESPNcricinfo\n: Article about Prabhakar's Hundred"

He was the 5th leading wicket taker in the competition with 34 wickets at an average of 24 He has had a disappointing 2007 season with Leicestershire though.\nIn 2008 he joined Cape Cobras and after consistent performances gained a place in the Cobras squad for the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 competition in India in 2009.\n2011 marked Henderson's testimonial year at Leicestershire. Despite this, he was also Leicester's leading wicket taker in the County Championship and was a significant contributor in the Foxes 2011 Friends Life t20 cup win, where his 4 over spell in the final against Somerset conceded just 11 runs. He was rewarded with a new contract at the end of the season.\nHenderson announced that he would be retiring from first class cricket at the end of the 2013 season at the age of 41. He plans to return to South Africa where he will become a television pundit and coach. His last game turned out to be the County Championship match at the end of April 2013 against Gloucestershire where his final victim was Benny Howell.\n\n\n== International cricket ==\nHenderson had to wait until 2001 to make his international debut after Nicky Boje needed surgery. He was selected to make his test debut against neighbours Zimbabwe in Harare. Following the retirement of Boje from the South African test side, Henderson was approached to replace him for the home series against India. Henderson rejected the approach because of his contract with Leicestershire, only willing to play for South Africa if he was given a contract with the South African cricket board.\n\n\n== Career Best Performances ==\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Mike Jackson is a recurring fictional character in the early novels by British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a good friend of Psmith. He appears in all the Psmith books.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMike is a solid, reliable character with a strong sense of fair play, but an appetite for excitement and a stubbornness that often leads him into trouble. He is a keen and talented cricketer, and comes from a cricketing family (his elder brothers have all distinguished themselves), and as we follow Mike's life he himself achieves considerable cricketing success. However, as Wodehouse's writing developed away from the school stories of his early period, cricket becomes a less important aspect of the tales, as does Mike himself.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nMike Jackson appears in five novel-length works, all of which appeared as magazine serials before being published in book form.\n\nIn his first appearance (\"Jackson Junior\", later retitled Mike at Wrykyn) Mike is the sole focus of the story.  Mike at Wrykyn starts with Mike heading off to prestigious Wrykyn school, where all his brothers had attended and one, Bob, is still an important figure, and a fixture in the school cricket team. Mike goes through many adventures, interspersed with cricket, during his first year at the school.\nIn \"The Lost Lambs\" (later known as Mike and Psmith or Enter Psmith), Mike is withdrawn from Wrykyn by his father after a poor academic performance, and must attend the less successful Sedleigh, much to his disgust. It is there, however, that he meets the charismatic Rupert Psmith, and the two become fast friends.\nIn \"The New Fold\" (later published as Psmith in the City), family financial troubles mean Mike cannot go to Cambridge as he had hoped, and must instead get a job at the (fictitious) New Asiatic Bank. Once there, however, he finds his friend Psmith also enrolled in the company, making his time there much more pleasurable.\nIn Psmith, Journalist, Mike, now enjoying success as a Cambridge cricketer, travels to the United States for a cricket tour. His friend Psmith comes along with him, and embroils the two in a dangerous adventure; by now, however, Mike has become a minor character, in the shadow of voluble Psmith.\nIn Leave It to Psmith, Mike only appears briefly early on; he is married to Phyllis, stepdaughter of Joseph Keeble, who is in turn married to Lord Emsworth's sister Lady Constance Keeble. Psmith falls for Phyllis' friend Eve Halliday, and the two strive to help out their impoverished friends.\n\n\n== Fictional biography ==\nMike's family appear in the early stories, and we learn that he has four brothers, one of them (Bob, three years older than Mike) in the Wrykyn cricket team, the other three (Joe, Reggie and Frank) all county players. He also has four younger sisters, Marjory (a year Mike's junior), Phyllis, Ella, and Gladys Maud Evangeline (the baby), and an Uncle John. His kindly father, who has business interests in the Argentine, employs a cricket pro, a loyal man named Saunders, to train his boys during the holidays. Their house is at Crofton, in Shropshire, where they keep a bulldog named John, Mike's inseparable companion during the holidays.\nMike's early schooling was at a private school named \"King-Hall's\", at Emsworth in Hampshire; he made seven centuries there in his last year, including one knock of 123. At the age of fifteen, a place is found for him at Wrykyn, where his brothers before him had attended.\nHis huge self-confidence and skill in batting bring him much success at Wrykyn, and his noble character makes him many friends. After three happy years there, as he is on the verge of taking over the captaincy of the cricket team, he is forced, thanks to poor academic work, to leave Wrykyn. He goes to Sedleigh, a lesser school which he resents, but it is there that he meets Psmith, with whom he would form a lasting friendship.\nHis first months at Sedleigh demonstrate his obstinate nature; unable to play for Wrykyn, he refuses to play for a lesser school, missing much cricket, although he does manage a few games for a local village side. Generally good-natured, Mike has a sharp temper at times, especially when he sees some injustice done to himself or a friend; he is invariably generous and helpful to friends in need. He also gets on well with dogs.\nAfter Sedleigh, Mike learns that his father's finances have taken a bit of a tumble, and rather than go to Cambridge, he will have to go to work at the New Asiatic Bank. He spends several months there, despite an early run-in with his employer John Bickersdyke, made more comfortable by the presence of Psmith on the scene, and eventually succumbs to the lure of sunshine and cricket, leaving his job to join his brother Joe in a match at Lord's. Psmith's father Mr Smith, seeing Mike's talent, decides to hire him as estate manager, paying for him to study at Cambridge first.\nDuring his first year there he makes a century against Oxford, and in the summer break he joins an M.C.C. team on a tour of America\nAfter university, Mike takes up his job with Psmith's father, and marries Phyllis. Unfortunately, old man Smith dies, leaving nothing but debts, and the people who buy his property have someone else to manage the estate, leaving Mike in difficulty. He finds temporary work as a schoolmaster, and has offered a farming business in Lincolnshire, but requires financial help from Joe Keeble.\nIn a preface to the 1953 version of Mike and Psmith, Wodehouse informs us that Mike would go on to become a prosperous farmer.\n\n\n== References =="

A marijuana user from a young age, he was almost thrown out of the 1975\u201376 tour to Australia, only saved by the intervention of the sympathetic senior player Lance Gibbs.  His drug habit was reportedly fuelled by a tour of India where he found drugs easily available: \"A waiter at the team hotel started the whole thing. There was a market there, near the Gateway of India, where you used to get anything, good African marijuana, everything... it's a great place.\" By 1978 he had moved on to cocaine.Murray spent most of his international career as understudy to his Trinidadian counterpart Deryck Murray, and was usurped in 1981 by Jeff Dujon of Jamaica. Frustrated at his lack of opportunities, he threw in his lot with the West Indian rebel tours to South Africa and received a lifetime ban in 1983.\nMurray now lives in poverty at his childhood home in Bridgetown.Murray\u2019s son, Ricky Hoyte, Weekes\u2019s grandson, was also a wicketkeeper, playing for Barbados in the 1990s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDabbling with drugs"

        "article": "Johannes Jacobus van der Wath (born 10 January 1978) is a former South African cricketer who played Limited Over Internationals.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nVan der Wath is an attacking right-handed batsman who usually bats in the lower middle order coming in and increasing the strike rate. He is also an aggressive right-arm medium-fast bowler who regularly takes wickets with the new ball.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nVan der Wath started his career off in 1995 with the Easterns in South Africa where he played one One Day match. The following year he made his first class debut but only played one more match after that before joining Free State for the beginning of the 1997 South African season. He scored his highest first class score of 113* in 2002 while playing for Free State. After 7 seasons with the club he joined the Eagles. It was here where he produced performances good enough for the Protea selectors to take notice of him and in his second season he made his international debut. He was banned from playing in South Africa when he joined the Indian Cricket League.\n\n\n=== England ===\nWhile still playing in South Africa, he joined Sussex in 2005 as an overseas player for the English season playing in 17 matches altogether. He then joined his second English county in 2007 playing for Northamptonshire, but didn't finish the season after being called up by South Africa for the World Twenty20, and he was replaced by Nicky Boje (who next year became captain). The next year his was signed as a Kolpak player, however just before the season started he was banned by the ECB for playing in the now defunct Indian Cricket League\n(ICL) alongside four other players including Northampton's new signing Andrew Hall. A month later after an appeal, he and Hall were allowed to play again, a spokesman said it was a \"unlawful, unreasonable, capricious and discriminatory\" ban. During that year, Johan recorded his best first class figures of 7/60 and took 43 wicket altogether that season. In 2009, he was an important team member of the Northants Steelbacks Twenty20 Cup squad that got to the finals day at Edgbaston. During the group stages he won the match against Worcestershire Royals scoring the 22 needed in the last over that kept Northamptonshire's winning run going. That season proved to be Johan's best season at Northants as he took over 50 first class wickets and scored just under 500 runs. Van der Wath and Riki Wessels were unable to play for the county in the 2010 season.\n\n\n=== Indian Cricket League ===\nVan der Wath only played two seasons of the Indian Cricket League before cancelling his own contract. He played for the Mumbai Champs alongside fellow international cricketers Nathan Astle, Tino Best and Michael Kasprowicz. He played 23 matches with a highest score of 43* against Ahmedabad Rockets and his best figures were 3/24 versus Chennai Superstars.For the 2011 season he has joined Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe played for Under 19's South African team in 97 making two appearances against Pakistan, making the step up to 'A' cricket four years later, playing up until 2006. Although Johan never played test cricket, he was a regular in the Protea one day side between 2006 and 2007 playing 10 ODI's and also 8 international Twenty20 matches. It was during this period in one of the matches, he scored a quick fire 35 from 18 balls on the way to the World Famous Chase of 434 against Australia.  His debut came when Jacques Kallis was injured during the VB Series in Australia, and played his first game at the Telstra Dome, in Melbourne. He retired from International Cricket in 2007 after South Africa also banned him due to him playing in the rebel Indian Cricket League. Two years later though, Johan along with Northants teammate Andrew Hall were allowed to play for their country again after ending their contracts with the ICL before the deadline of 31 May 2009 set by Cricket South Africa.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohan van der Wath at ESPNcricinfo\nJohan van der Wath at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

        "article": "Jonathan Moss (born 4 May 1975) is an Australian cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler, who played for the Victorian Bushrangers from season 2000/01 to 2006/07.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMoss was born in Sydney, where his parents had emigrated to from England only a few years before, and is Jewish. He was educated at exclusive SCEGS in North Sydney(Shore School), and was in the 1st IX and 1st XV. \n\n His older brother, Phil Moss, was born in London, and has been notable in Australian soccer circles as both a player and a manager.\n\nPrior to his first-class debut, Moss played for Australia in the Maccabiah Games in Israel, a competition in which the best Jewish sportsmen from around the world compete representing their country. The bridge collapsed as Moss and the Australian team was walking on the bridge in Tel Aviv on the way to the opening games, killing four people. Moss fell into the river.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nThe Sydney native first played cricket for Hampshire's Second XI in one game in 2000, before moving back to his home country and playing for Victoria, as he was unable to crack the New South Wales squad. His performance as a middle-order batsman in the Victorian team assisted them to the finals of the 2000\u201301 and 2003\u201304 Pura Cup finals; Moss averaged around 60 for the tournament.\nMoss then moved to England, where he appeared almost two months later for Derbyshire for the first time. He struggled to make himself a part of the first team during his first two seasons at the club, and made a failed transfer request to return to New South Wales.\n\n\n== Later highlights ==\nIn season 2005/06 international selection was suggested by numerous journalists (such as Darren Berry), after a strong start to the season with both bat and ball, but his age of 32 was seen as a barrier, and it never eventuated. However, he finished off an excellent season with 295 runs (at an average of 29.50) in the ING Cup, and 413 (at an average of 27) runs in the Pura Cup, plus 20 wickets in the same competition, as Victoria made the Pura Cup final.\nIn 2006/07 he faced an inconsistent season in Pura Cup cricket, scoring just 149 runs (at an average of 18.62), whilst his medium pacers proved handy, taking 14 wickets (at 28.14) in a decent return, but it was not enough to make Moss a permanent fixture, and he was in and out of the side at times. Moss was more consistent in the renamed Ford Ranger (OD) cup, scoring 344 runs (at 31.27), playing every match, but failing to score a century.\nMoss is also an accomplished golfer, playing off single figures and taking the trophy at this year's Tin Cup XI Golf Tournament at the Mollymook Hilltops Golf Club on the NSW South Coast.\nAt the end of his agreed one-year contract it was amicably agreed to part ways with Victoria and he returned to Sydney in 2007, bringing to a close a career which featured 4482 first-class runs (at 35.01), with 7 centuries and 30 half centuries, the honour of being vice captain and stand in captain, in a match which brought upon his highest ever FC score of 172 (not out), and 131 wickets (at 33.93) in FC cricket as well.\nOn his return he played for the Sydney Cricket Club (formerly UTS Balmain) in Sydney Grade Cricket. By 2011 he was putting his skills to use with sportsgear maker Puma SE Australia, as a well regarded motivating speaker and as part of the Fox Sports Cricket Commentary Team.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJonathan Moss at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nJonathan Moss at ESPNcricinfo\nMoss and Arnberger lose in Victoria reshuffle from cricinfo.com\nMoss goes home to Sydney from cricinfo.com"

        "article": "Ryan Neil ten Doeschate (Dutch pronunciation: ['t\u025bn 'dusx\u0251\u02d0t\u0259]; born 30 June 1980) is a Dutch\u2013South African cricketer who has represented the Netherlands at both One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) level. He has been named ICC Associate Player of the Year on a record three occasions, in 2008, 2010, and 2011.\nBorn and raised in South Africa, ten Doeschate signed with Essex CCC for the 2003 English season, qualifying under the Kolpak ruling through his Dutch (and hence European Union) citizenship. A right-handed all-rounder, he first represented the Dutch national team at the 2005 ICC Trophy, and has since played a number of other tournaments for the side, including the 2009 World Twenty20 and the 2011 World Cup. At the latter tournament, ten Doeschate scored 119 runs against England, the first ODI century by a Dutch player against a full member of the ICC.\nAt domestic level, ten Doeschate first established himself as a regular for Essex during the 2006 season, and was named the team's limited-overs captain for the 2014 season. He has also represented a number of professional Twenty20 sides in other countries, including franchises in Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash, the Bangladesh Premier League, the Indian Premier League, New Zealand's HRV Twenty20, South Africa's MiWay T20 Challenge, and Zimbabwe's Stanbic Bank 20 Series.\nIn September 2021, ten Doeschate announced that he would retire from professional cricket at the end of 2021.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nHe matriculated at Fairbairn College in Goodwood, near Cape Town in 1998. While at school, he excelled at both rugby and cricket.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nIn 2003, Graham Gooch was on tour with Essex in South Africa and saw ten Doeschate's talent for the first time in a match against a Western Province second XI. Against Essex, he first excelled with the ball in a four-day game.\nHe then did well with the bat in a one-dayer. It did not take long for Gooch to talk to old friend Peter Kirsten one of the Western Province coaches who mentioned ten Doeschate's EU citizenship passport that would make him eligible to play in England.\nIn 2008, ten Doeschate became one of the cornerstones of a strong Essex team and enjoyed success with them by winning the Friends Provident Trophy and Pro40 Division 2.\nDuring a Clydesdale Bank 40 match against the Derbyshire Falcons, ten Doeschate managed 109 not out as the Essex Eagles won on the Duckworth-Lewis method.\nIn 2010, ten Doeschate led the batting averages for Essex in England's Friends Provident t20, making 296 runs in six matches at an average of 59.20. He also had best economy-rate for his side, conceding 6.81 runs an over, though he bowled only 11 overs.\nIn 2010, he signed with Tasmania for the Twenty20 Big Bash in 2010/11. He was joined Pakistan fast bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan as Tasmania's two international players the season.\nTen Doeschate was declared the Most Valuable Player the last time he played in the tournament for Canterbury in the 2010/11 season with 284 runs from nine games to be the second-highest run-getter in the league.\nHe was also their joint fourth-highest wicket-taker, with 12 wickets in nine games at an average of 17.66 and played a key role in their wins over Wellington and Otago early in the competition.\nIn January 2011, ten Doeschate was picked by the Kolkata Knight Riders team in the IPL 2011 Auction for $150,000. ten Doeschate also was the first Associate player to win an IPL contract. His selection made ten Doeschate the second Dutch player after Dirk Nannes to play in the Indian Premier League.\nIn 2011, he smashed 121 not out off 58 balls to lead Mashonaland Eagles to the final of the Stanbic Bank 20 Series. Ten Doeschate's hundred helped Eagles beat Matabeleland Tuskers by 23 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method in the qualifying final and set up a clash with Mountaineers. He struck eight sixes and six fours in his innings and was unperturbed by wickets falling at the other end.\nIn 2012, he signed Otago Volts in the HRV Cup, New Zealand's T20 league. During the season ten Doeschate finished second on the runs-scorer list with 401 runs in 10 innings at an average of 50.12.\nIn 2013, in the Bangladesh Premier League, The Kings needed one batsman to take charge, and after Brendan Taylor left that responsibility was taken by ten Doeschate. Ten Doeschate finished as the second highest run-scorer of the tournament. The form of Ravi Bopara had initially led to ten Doeschate being benched; ten Doeschate held firm, and in the crucial moments, his stylish shots came out readily when required. Even when wickets were falling at the other end, and he was struggling with his timing, ten Doeschate had an answer case in point, the second semifinal against the Sylhet Royals when he struck a vital 44 off 28 balls to steer the Kings home, and into the BPL final.\nIn 2013, ten Doeschate and Hamish Rutherford produced exhilarating performances with the bat as Essex beat Scotland by 125 runs at Chelmsford. The home side reached 368 for 7 to record their highest 40-overs total before their opponents responded with 243 for 8. ten Doeschate thrashed his way to 180 as his best limited-overs score for the county while New Zealand international Rutherford powered his way to 110 on his Essex debut with the pair posting 230 in 22.1 overs, a new county record for the fourth wicket in List A matches.\nIn 2016 he was appointed captain of Essex in First-Class cricket. In his first season in this capacity, he led Essex to promotion to first division of the County Championship. Remarkably, under his leadership, Essex won the Championship in their first year back in the upper division. No longer considered a bowling option except in emergencies, his batting alone justifies his place in the team and is augmented by his captaincy and dynamic fielding. In January 2020, he stepped down as the captain of Essex after leading his club for four straight seasons.Speaking on the 22 Yarns podcast hosted by Gaurav Kapur, ten Doeschate announced that he would be retiring from the sport at the end of the 2021 County Championship.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn successive innings in international matches for The Netherlands in the ICC Intercontinental Cup competition in 2005 and 2006 he scored 84, 158, 138, 100 and finally 259 not out in the victory over Canada in December 2006. This latter innings set a new record for the competition, breaking the mark of 247 established by Bermuda's David Hemp earlier in the same tournament.Ten Doeschate was selected in the Netherlands squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. In a warm-up match prior to the World Cup, he captured five wickets against a strong India team. His haul included the wickets of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He followed this up by scoring 57 runs off 74 balls.\nIn the opening match of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, he contributed to the shock defeat of the host nation England by the Netherlands by bowling opening batsmen Ravi Bopara and Luke Wright and being the not out batsman with a score of 22.October 2010, ten Doeschate was named Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at the ICC Awards in Bangalore. He had previously won this award in 2008. During the qualifying period, he made one century and three half centuries in ODIs. Ten Doeschate won over Afghanistan's Mohammad Shahzad and the Irish duo of Trent Johnston and Kevin O'Brien. In 2011 he was chosen ahead of Afghanistan fast bowler Hamid Hassan and the Irish centurions in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Paul Stirling and Kevin O'Brien, during the awards ceremony in London.\nIn a game against Ireland, ten Doeschate became the third player after AB de Villiers and Sachin Tendulkar to score two centuries in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. The 121-run stand between ten Doeschate and Peter Borren is the highest for the fifth wicket for Netherlands in ODIs.\nOn 14 November 2017, ten Doeschate was recalled to the national set up after almost a six-year international absence in order to help the Dutch qualify for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.In February 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named ten Doeschate as one of the ten players to watch ahead of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament. In September 2019, he was named in the Dutch squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Ahead of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as the key player in the Dutch squad. In September 2021, he was named in the Dutch squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\n\n=== Batting graph ===\n\n\n== T20 franchise career ==\nHe has represented Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL and was one of their key-players. In September 2018, he was named in Balkh's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. The following month, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018\u201319 Bangladesh Premier League. During the 2019 Mzansi Super League, ten Doeschate joined the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants as a replacement for the injured Farhaan Behardien.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricket World Cup 2011 Profile\nRyan ten Doeschate at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Mattheus Hendrik \"Riki\" Wessels (born 12 November 1985) is an Australian-English cricketer who most recently played for Worcestershire. A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, Wessels has played for Marylebone Cricket Club, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire, and also for the Mid West Rhinos in Zimbabwe and the Sydney Sixers in Australia. He is the son of former South African captain Kepler Wessels, who also played 24 Test matches for Australia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWessels was born in Queensland, Australia, where his father was playing domestic cricket at the time. After Kepler decided to return to South Africa, Riki grew up in Port Elizabeth. Cricket was not an automatic choice for him, as he was also a keen hockey player, but at 18 he made the decision to pursue a cricket career in England.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nIn 2004, Wessels joined the staff at Northamptonshire county cricket club where he impressed in the second eleven producing several noticeable scores. This led to him being selected for the MCC in 2004 and in the first team of Nottinghamshire for the start of the 2011 season. In 2004, he established himself as a first class player, and scored his first century at the age of 19 against Somerset. In 2007, he became qualified to play for England which is what he has wanted to do from an early age. Being a keen hockey player (playing for Northampton Lions and the University of Northampton teams) helps him to play a variety of shots including the reverse sweep for which he is well known. He is a fairly attacking player especially in one-day cricket, where he has one century to date. On 7 November 2008, Wessels signed a new contract extension along with fellow Northamptonshire wicket keeper Niall O'Brien, keeping Riki at the club until 2010.He also turned out for Nondescripts Cricket Club in Sri Lanka during the English off Season between 2008 and 2010.\nWessels signed for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club for the 2011 season, where he plies his trade as a specialist batsman.\nHe was signed as a specialist batsman by the Sydney Sixers in the 2014/2015 Big Bash League tournament in Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRiki Wessels at ESPNcricinfo\nRiki Wessels at CricketArchive (subscription required)\n[1]"

        "article": "Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana KCSI, OBE (7 August 1900 \u2013 20 January 1975) (Punjabi: \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u062e\u0636\u0631\u062d\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u062a\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06c1) was an Indian statesman, army officer, and landowner who served as the Unionist Premier of the Punjab in colonial India between 1942 and 1947.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nKhizar was born at Chak Muzaffarabad, in the district of Sargodha, Punjab in 1900. He was born into the Tiwana family of Shahpur and his father Sir Umar Hayat Khan was a wealthy landowner and soldier who was an elected member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India. He was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore.\n\n\n=== Military career ===\nAt the age of 16 he volunteered for war service and was commissioned to the 17th Cavalry as a temporary honorary second lieutenant in the Indian Land Forces on 17 April 1918. In addition to his brief World War I service, Khizar also briefly served in the Third Anglo-Afghan War which followed, earning a mention in dispatches. He was advanced to honorary second lieutenant on 21 November 1919, and was promoted to the honorary rank of captain on 17 April 1923. Khizar thereafter assisted his father in the management of the family estates in the Punjab, taking responsibility for them while his father was in London. He was promoted to honorary Major on 17 April 1936 and was promoted to honorary lieutenant-colonel on 12 January 1943.\n\n\n=== Entry into politics ===\nKhizar was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly in 1937. He immediately joined the cabinet of Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan as Minister of Public Works and Local Self Government. Khizar lacked public speaking skills and administrative experience and obtained the position largely through his father's reputation and the standing of his family. Despite this, he became a trusted member of the cabinet and was entrusted with the home portfolio responsible for dealing with the police and law and order. At the outbreak of the Second World War he had been placed in charge of the Manpower Committee of the Punjab War Board and the Civil Defence Departments. In 1940 he was responsible for handling the Unionist Party's dealings with the Allama Mashriqi and for arranging security at the All-India Muslim League sessions in Lahore.\nHis achievements included overseeing reform of the panchayat system by extending their administrative, fiscal and judicial functions, and ensuring improvements to infrastructure and irrigation networks. He steadfastly supported the Unionist pro-agricultural policies, and sympathised with their endeavours to promote communal harmony.\n\n\n=== Premier of the Punjab ===\n\nIn 1942 Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan unexpectedly died creating a vacancy as Premier. The position was eyed by the three dominant Muslim factions, the Noon-Tiwana, Daultanas and the Hayats. Khizar was unanimously selected as his successor on 23 January 1943.Khizar assumed control during the height of the Second World War. Many Punjabi soldiers had been killed, others returned maimed, and demobilised soldiers were not being immediately allotted parcels of land in the canal colonies. To feed Bengalis suffering the Bengal famine of 1943, the central government in Delhi instructed Khizar's government to introduce rationing in the Punjab and fix grain prices which in turn affected landowner's financially. A war weariness descended over the Punjab, and food shortages, fixed prices, and their support for conscription, damaged attitudes towards Khizar's government from rich and poor Muslim alike.Like Sikandar, Khizar was staunchly opposed to the idea of Pakistan, yet unlike his predecessor was less willing to compromise or bow to Jinnah's dictation. Jinnah increasingly sought to enforce the Sikandar-Jinnah pact and wield influence over the government claiming that as the Muslims of the Unionist party also belonged to the Muslim League, the Punjab government was a League government and should submit to directives of the Muslim League leadership. In April 1944 Jinnah demanded that the name of the Unionist Party be changed to the Muslim League Coalition Party. Khizar rebuffed these demands asserting that his government was a coalition with Hindus, rather than a Muslim League government Tension with Jinnah simmered until Khizar was expelled from the Muslim League later that year. This opened a rift within the Unionist Party, with Muslim members now forced to choose between Khizar and the Muslim League. Following this clash, the Muslim League waged an increasing vitriolic campaign against him, denouncing him as a 'quisling' and 'kafir'. Mock funerals were held outside his official residence and he was greeted wherever he went with black flags of protest.Khizar suffered a further blow in January 1945 with the death of Sir Chhottu Ram. Ram was the leader of the Hindu Jats in south eastern Punjab, a pillar of the Unionist Party and greatly respected by Muslims in the province. Jinnah increased the pressure on Khizar at the Simla Conference of 1945. Convened by the Viceroy of India Lord Wavell, the conference was to put together an interim government in India following the war. Jinnah insisted that any Muslim nominee to the government must be selected by the Muslim League, as only they spoke for the entirety of Muslims in India. This was seen as an attempt to undermine the influence of the Unionist Party, and its ability to represent its Muslim constituency. In September 1945, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, a member of the Noon-Tiwana faction, resigned from the Unionist party and urged Khizar and other Unionists to join the Muslim League. Noon had previously been a key ally for Khizar, assuring him that he would help heal his rift with Jinnah and urging him to not divide the Punjabi Muslims - the heart of Muslim India. Noon's defection opened the gates for further defections from the party. Other defectors included Sikandar's son, Shaukat Hayat Khan and Mumtaz Daultana, who both realigned their families support towards the Muslim League.\nAt the Indian provincial elections of 1946, the Muslim League won seventy nine seats to the Punjab Assembly, and reduced the Unionists to just ten. Despite this crushing defeat for Khizar and the Unionists, the Muslim League were unable to form a government as they lacked an absolute majority. Khizar struck a deal with the Congress Party and Akali Dal and was invited to form a coalition government. His cabinet included Sir Muzaffar Ali Khan Qizilbash, Bhim Sen Sachar and Baldev Singh. The coalition proved a disaster, as for the first time a predominately non-Muslim government held power. From the outset the Muslim League organised a programme of civil disobedience and disruption to the province. The Muslim League argued it was an example of Hindu connivance to defeat the interests of the Muslim community. Khizar was portrayed as a traitor, clinging to power and office without regard for the interests of the Muslims.Khizar remained opposed to the partition of India to the end. He felt that Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus of the Punjab all had a common culture and was against dividing India to create a religious segregation between the same people. Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, himself a Muslim, remarked to the separatist leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah: \"There are Hindu and Sikh Tiwanas who are my relatives. I go to their weddings and other ceremonies. How can I possibly regard them as coming from another nation?\" He refused to accept the two-nation theory, and believed that a Muslim majority government in the Punjab would be an important guarantee of the rights of Muslims in a minority province. Tiwana advocated for amity between the religious communities of undivided India, proclaiming March 1 as Communal Harmony Day and aiding in the establishment of a Communal Harmony Committee in Lahore presided over by Raja Narendra Nath with its secretary being Maulvi Mahomed Ilyas of Bahawalpur. As a last ditch attempt to avoid partition, Khizar attempted to convince the British to accept his proposal for an independent Punjabi state, a separate entity to both India and Pakistan.He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in the 1946 New Year Honours and was a member of the Indian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in the summer of 1946. Due to the boycotts engulfing the Punjab, he resigned as Premier on 2 March 1947. Sir Evan Jenkins, as Governor of the Punjab assumed direct control of the Punjab until the day of partition, 14 August 1947.\n\n\n=== Later life ===\nHe retired from politics following his resignation, and lived for a time in Simla and Delhi following independence. He returned to the Kalra Estate in the newly created Pakistan in October 1949.In 1951, Mumtaz Daultana targeted those who were against the Pakistan movement by proposing a law confiscating without redress, all land grants issued during the premiership of Khizar. In Tiwana's hometown of Shahpur, this would amount to 10,000 acres. Alarmed by these measures, Khizar appealed to the British government without success. In 1954, Daultana would confiscate all the private canals owned by Khizar under the guise of the Punjab Minor Canals Bill.In his final visit to the United States, Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana, reflecting on the creation of Bangladesh, echoed his opposition to the partition of India, particularly the division of the Punjab Province, stating: \"I still think a Punjabi Muslim has more in common with a Punjabi Hindu than with a Bengali (or any non-Punjabi really) and I think the separation of East Pakistan proved that.\"He died in Butte City, California, on 20 January 1975.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKhizr Tiwana, Ian Talbot, Oxford University Press, c 2002"

An all-rounder, Durani was a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and a left-handed batsman famous for his six-hitting prowess. He is the only Indian Test cricketer to have been born in Afghanistan.Durani was the hero of India's series victory against England in 1961\u201362. He took 8 and 10 wickets in their wins at Kolkata and Chennai, respectively. Also, a decade later, he would be instrumental in India's maiden victory against the West Indies at Port of Spain, taking the wickets of Clive Lloyd and Gary Sobers.In his 50 Test innings, he made just the one century, 104 against the West Indies in 1962. He played for Gujarat, Rajasthan and Saurashtra in first-class cricket. He made 14 hundreds in first-class cricket in which he managed 8545 runs at 33.37. He has the distinction of being the only cricketer that would respond to a demand from the crowd to hit a six. The crowd would cheer, \"We want a sixer!\" and Durani would hit one. Durani had a special rapport with the spectators, who once agitated when he was inexplicably dropped from the team for the Kanpur Test in 1973, with placards and slogans such as, \"No Durani, no test!\".\nAs he is the only Afghanistan-born Indian test cricketer he was also present during the historic India vs Afghanistan test match on 14 June 2018.\nHe appeared in the film Charitra with Parveen Babi in 1973.

The character, created by writer and illustrator Anupam Sinha, first appeared in GENL #74 Pratishodh Ki Jwala  published in April 1987 and since then, has appeared regularly in many issues published by Raj Comics. Super Commando Dhruva, whose complete name is Dhruva Mehra, is additionally referred to as Captain Dhruva by the cadets of his Commando Force.\nSuper Commando Dhruva operates in the fictional Indian city of Rajnagar. He is the founder of a fictional government-approved crime fighter organization Commando Force. The character's appearance is distinctive and iconic: a yellow and sky blue costume, brown boots and a utility belt with a star-shaped buckle. The star has almost become a trademark of the character. The most unusual thing about Dhruva is that, unlike most other superheroes, he doesn't have an alter ego and doesn't hide his identity behind a mask. Another unique thing about him is that he doesn't possess any superpowers; but he makes up for that with his intellect, detective skills, ability to talk to almost every kind of animals, scientific knowledge, martial art and acrobatic skills, an unparalleled willpower and a determination to eliminate evil from this world.\nDhruva became a very popular character soon after he was introduced. He is one of Raj Comics' most successful characters. Over the years, Dhruva has acquired an iconic status in the Indian comic book superhero genre.\nFans have often raised the demand to convert Dhruva into a Bollywood movie character\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\nIn the late 1980s, after the initial success of Nagraj, Raj Comics wanted another superhero for its titles. It was in this period that writer Anupam Sinha came up with the idea of Super Commando Dhruva.Dhruva's original design, as created by Sinha back in 1987, was an adolescent boy standing beside his bike wearing a yellow-blue trapeze artist costume, buttoned shirt collar, a black belt with star buckle, shoes (instead of boots), and with no gloves, mask, or cape, holding a helmet in his hand. The background of the image had a big star polygon and behind his left shoulder was a box containing  \"\u0927\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0935\". Sinha wanted Dhruva to wear a helmet, making him a biker hero, but later on many changes were incorporated to the character's look, including the removal of the helmet.\nSinha wanted to break away from the clich\u00e9 of superheroes with super-natural powers and alter egos. He wanted to create a superhero out of a normal adult human. Sinha, during the 2012 Indian Comic Con festival, recalled: \"Children see the world very differently, and there is a reason for it. Every person seems like a giant to them and people can do something that they cannot. Like taking out a jar of toffees from the cupboard. And the adult is thus a superhero, because they can do something that the child cannot do. Kids see every person as a super hero. They are heavily dependent on other people. Tell me, when do you move out of reading comics? When you are an independent human being. Fantasy does not interest you all that much. The psychology of being dependent, of 'I must have a person along with me to protect me from any impending danger,' is essentially a child's psyche. That\u2019s why I wrote this character Super Commando Dhruva.\"Sinha's first two characters Space Star and Private Detective Kapil didn't become very popular, but served as the early drafts for Super Commando Dhruva. The name Dhruva and the star symbol given to the character were inspired by Dhruva Taara (Hindi: \u0927\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0935 \u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e meaning Pole Star) which means someone who is determined, firm, and doesn't succumb to rough circumstances.\nThus, Super Commando Dhruva was born: a normal adult with no supernatural power but a strong determination and will to fight against the odds much along the lines of Batman of DC Comics. Most fans feel that Dhruva's character is a mix of Batman and Robin. On one hand, his crime fighting style is very similar to that of Batman's and, on the other hand, his origin resembles to that of Robin's. In spite of these similarities, there are a lot of differences as well, most notably being the fact that Dhruva doesn't have an alter ego. Other similarities to Batman series are, Dhruva does not kill anyone and his girlfriend Natasha is daughter of a major villain Grand Master Robo. Batman's girlfriend Talia al Ghul is daughter of Ra's al Ghul.\nWhen questioned about the comparisons between characters of the Raj Comics universe and DC/Marvel universe at the 2012 Indian Comic Con Festival, Sanjay Gupta replied, \"We had to devise a character from our own imagination that didn't have anything to do with them (Superman and Batman). Because if we had kept in mind how powerful Superman and Batman are... We would've reacted to it and somehow allowed that to play a part in our creative process. Our first goal was to make a total Indian character. We didn't want to copy. That wasn't going on in our heads. But we were definitely inspired by them. We are still inspired by them. Even today we don\u2019t copy... We are inspired by them. After all, everything has an origin.\"\n\n\n=== Publication ===\n\nSuper Commando Dhruva made his first appearance in GENL #74 \"Pratishodh Ki Jwala\", published in 1987. A general (GENL) issue used to be a 30- to 32-page issue. Dhruva's first issue dealt with the origin of the character.\nIn the next issue, GENL #79 \"Roman Hatyara\", Dhruva founded a government-approved crime fighter organisation Star Commando Force.\nGENL #147 \"Swarg Ki Tabahi\" introduced Chandika, the main supporting character of the Dhruva series. Eventually it was revealed that Chandika was his foster-sister Shweta Mehra. Over the course of next few issues, some key elements were added to Dhruva's character including star-line, star-blade, a utility belt, ability to communicate with dolphins and ability to breathe underwater.\nSinha was very sure about one thing: minimal violence. He would not have Dhruva kill anyone as he wanted Dhruva to be a role model for young kids, his main audience. In the initial few issues, Dhruva carried a pistol as a measure of last resort, but never used it. (Dhruv used the pistol in Aadamkhoro ka Swarg. He used and fired two rounds on the Rhino-men in the Nagu Islands). This was the first and last time he ever used his gun. Soon after, the pistol was removed from the character.\nDuring the initial few years, Anupam Sinha preferred to work alone on his brain-child Dhruva, both writing as well as illustrating all Dhruva titles on his own while the cover arts for the titles were mostly supplied by Vijay Kadam, an independent freelance artist.\nIn 1991, when Raj Comics decided to publish its first special (SPCL) issue, they aptly chose to title it, SPCL #1 \"Nagraj aur Super Commando Dhruva\" which featured Nagraj and Dhruva in prominent roles alongside other Raj Comics superheroes. This issue brought Nagraj and Dhruva together for the first time. In this issue, Dhruva was shown to kill a lot of criminals. This was due to the fact that this issue was written by Sanjay Gupta, the writer of Nagraj, and not by Sinha.\nThe next special issue was a landmark issue in many ways. SPCL #2 \"Grand Master Robo\" was the first solo-hero special issue published by Raj Comics and Dhruva's first solo special issue. It added a lot of new elements to the character's story. It introduced Swarna Nagri (Golden City), which is located at the base of the ocean and hidden from human eyes. Swarna Nagri is the home of Swarna Manavas (Golden Humans), descendants of Devs (Gods). Dhananjay, a warrior from Swarna Nagri, initially fought Dhruva, but became his friend and gave him the power to breathe inside water.\nThis issue also introduced Natasha, daughter of Grand Master Robo and Dhruva's love interest. Natasha went on to become the first and only person to know Chandika's secret identity. Dhruva's ability to communicate with animals and birds was well established but this issue explored Dhruva's ability to communicate with dolphins as well. In 1993, Black Cat (alter ego: Richa) was introduced in a self-titled issue to further complicate Dhruva's love life.\nInitially, Dhruva's stories were detective-based stories, with science fiction elements as well. With the success of special issues, Raj Comics scrapped the publishing of general issues for its top two heroes Dhruva and Nagraj, although they continued to publish general issues for other superheroes. From 1991 to 1995, the frequency of Dhruva's solo general issues kept on decreasing and solo special issues kept on increasing.\nGENL #585 \"Chandakal Ki Wapasi\", published in 1995, was the character's last solo general issue. Since then, Dhruva has only been seen in the special issues. With this transition from general issues to special issues, Sinha's storytelling also changed. Dhruva's comics now contain more science fiction-based time and space travels.\nInstead of fighting thugs, he was now fighting against supervillains, aliens, and even demons. He was not solving cases anymore, but was saving the world from bigger threats. Although a few fans objected to this transformation of the character, most accepted this change. In spite of this flurry of sci-fi/mythical superhero acts, Sinha strived not to lose the basic essence of the character.\nIn the midst of these superhero acts, Sinha came up with some iconic and critically acclaimed issues exploring Dhruva's personal life and human side of his character. One such issue was SPCL #64 \"Commander Natasha\", published in 1996. This issue dealt with Robo's and Natasha's past and brought turmoil in Dhruva's love life eventually ending with Natasha leaving Dhruva and joining Robo's crime syndicate once again.\nAlthough Dhruva's origin was explained very clearly in his first issue itself, not much was known about his family background. SPCL #100 \"Khooni Khandaan\" published in 1997 was a landmark issue in many ways. Not only was it the hundredth special issue published by Raj Comics, it was also the first of an iconic three part series that dealt with Dhruva's family background. Dhruva comes to know that his biological father was actually a French citizen on the run, wanted for murder. What ensues was an emotional journey for Dhruva to prove his dead father's innocence and remove the stigma of being a murderer from his name.\nSPCL #2245 \"Gupt\", dealt with the turmoils and side effects of being a superhero without an alter ego. A new supervillain Alchemist targeted Dhruva's foster family forcing him to wonder whether it was a mistake to become a crime fighter without a secret identity and jeopardising his family's security.\nAround the year 1995, when Sanjay Gupta got busy with the development of a new superhero Doga, he handed over the job of writing and drawing Nagraj to Anupam Sinha. This paved the way for one of the greatest superhero partnerships in Raj Comics. Dhruva and Nagraj, though popular individually, failed to make a mark when they came together twice before, both issues written by Sanjay Gupta. In 1996, Sinha came up with SPCL #67 \"Rajnagar Ki Tabahi\". This mega 90 page issue brought the 2 superheroes together for the third time overall but for the first time under the writing of Anupam Sinha. It was a huge critical and commercial success for Raj Comics. Raj Comics went on to declare the year 1997 as Nagraj Dhruva Double Action Year. This year saw all Raj Comics heroes featuring in two hero crossover issue with each other. Nagraj and Dhruva too featured in two back to back 90 pages two hero issues that year, \"Pralay\" & \"Vinaash\", as part of the celebration of Nagraj Dhruva Double Action Year. Since then both Nagraj and Dhruva have appeared in many two-hero and multi-hero issues all of which have been huge hits. The biggest and most ambitious project of Raj Comics, \"Nagayana\", based on Hindu epic Ramayana, was an 8 part futuristic series set in an alternate universe published in a span of 3 years from 2007 to 2009. This series too was a two hero project featuring Nagraj and Dhruva. Fans have likened the partnership of Nagraj-Dhruva with the Superman-Batman partnership in DC Comics, an invincible superhero and a superhero with no supernatural powers.\nDhruva was one of the few Indian comic book heroes that continued to be published regularly during The Dark Age of Indian Comics between 1997 and 2003 owing to his dedicated fan base.  While most of the Indian comic book publishing companies were shutting shops, Sinha continued to give timely boosts to Raj Comics through Dhruva-Nagraj crossover partnerships.\nIn 2000, SPCL #185 \"Kohraam\" was published which brought almost all superheroes together. Eventually in 2001, SPCL #235 \"Zalzalaa\" was published in which a superhero team \"Brahmand Rakshak\" (Protectors of the Universe) was formed, much on the lines of The Avengers and The Justice League. All Raj Comics superheroes including Dhruva became a member of this team.\nFrom 1987 to 2010, Anupam Sinha worked on every single Dhruva solo titles as well as most of the multi-hero titles featuring Dhruva. All these years, various writers worked on Dhruva (most notably Jolly Sinha) but Anupam Sinha was always attached to Dhruva titles in some or the other way, as a writer/co-writer and/or artist. In 2010 though, much to the disappointment of the fans, he declared that he will be taking an indefinite break from Super Commando Dhruva.  He wrote his last solo title for Dhruva in 2010 and ironically, or rather aptly, titled it \"Game Over\". Sinha continued to work on Nagraj solo titles as well as multi-hero titles featuring Nagraj and Dhruva but stopped working on solo Dhruva titles. Raj Comics studio handed over the job of Dhruva solo titles to younger writers/artists.\nSinha always maintained a character continuity in his storylines throughout his solo and crossovers storylines. After Sinha left, with multiple writers working on the character simultaneously, it became more and more unclear as to which Dhruva storyline belongs to the original continuity and which does not. New Writers added subtle changes to the character, although keeping the basic essence of the character still intact. They tried to introduce some new facets to the character. Writer Abhishek Sagar tried to break away from the Anupam Sinha style of writing by giving his stories darker undertones. Even the artists showed the tendency to use darker colors in Sagar's stories unlike Sinha whose artwork used to be brighter and more colorful. Nitin Mishra came up with contemporary storylines like 'Hum Honge Kamyaab' in 2010, which was his take on the controversies attached with the Commonwealth Games conducted in India in 2010. In this title Dhruva was shown to be more tech-savvy as compared to his earlier versions. In 'Samudri Lutere', Nitin Mishra showed a happier and brighter side of Dhruva. In this title, one of the Toads mentioned that Dhruva is a lover boy and Dhruva even displayed his musical talent as a good flautist. In Mandar Gangele's 'Gehri Chaal', Dhruva shot an ad for 'Anti-smoking campaign'. This was in contrast to Sinha's Dhruva who never showed any inclination towards music, acting or solving realistic cases based on contemporary issues.\nIn October 2012, Raj comics launched Nagraj-Pratishodh Ki Jwala Silver Jubilee Edition at the 2nd Mumbai Films and Comics Convention. It was a deluxe edition that contained the reprints of the debut issues of Nagraj and Dhruva on jumbo (34.6 * 24.8 cm) sized papers to celebrate the completion of 25yrs of the two most popular characters of Raj comics.\nIn December 2014, a series named \"Bal Charit\" was launched, with its first issue \"Hunters\" being released. This series is projected to be a milestone, with Dhruv's childhood to be told in great detail for the first time.\nIn 2015, \"Rajnagar Rakshak\" series was launched, with the first issue of the same name being released in January. This series is special because Dhruv is featured for first time with Inspector Steel in a 2 in 1 comic, despite both the superheroes being in action in the same city for a long time.\nIn September 2020, Manoj Gupta authored a short comic book featuring Super Commando Dhruva battling Depression. The comic book was released as a free for all special issue intended to spread awareness on World Suicide Prevention Day. \"For writers Manoj Gupta and Ayush Gupta, the aim wasn't to spread awareness about mental illness but instead, to normalise it.\", writes Dalreen Ramos in an article for Mid-Day.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nDhruva was born to a couple who worked as trapeze artists in Jupiter Circus. He received most of his martial art, acrobatic, and stunt training in the circus itself. At the age of 14, having lost his parents in a conspiracy that arose out of a business rivalry, he swore to fight against crime for the rest of his life. Eventually he was adopted by the then Superintendent of Police Rajan Mehra.\nDhruva was born to Shyam and Radha, two trapeze artists who used to perform in Jupiter Circus situated on the outskirts of Rajnagar. Dhruva was brought up in the circus itself. Growing up amongst the tigers, elephants, and other pet animals of the circus, Dhruva learnt to communicate with the animals. Dhruva was loved by every Jupiter Circus performer, started learning their respective skills from them. Strongman Hercules taught him body building. Ringmaster taught him how to control animals. He learned to throw knives from the knife thrower, along with shooting and bike stunts. At the age of 14, he started performing in Jupiter Circus shows and his stunning performances helped Jupiter to become a hugely popular circus. Boss, the owner of rival Globe Circus, hatched a conspiracy to destroy Jupiter Circus and sent Jubisko, his strongman and Bond, a sharpshooter to do the task. Jubisko burnt the Jupiter Circus killing everyone in it including Dhruva's parents. Dhruva who survived the carnage, vowed to avenge the deaths of his loved ones and eliminate the evil from the society. The series of events that followed resulted in the shutting down of Globe Circus as well. Later, the city police chief Rajan Mehra adopted Dhruva as his own son. Dhruva chose to carry on his struggle against crime choosing Rajnagar as the base of his operation.\n\n\n== Characterization ==\n\n\n=== Physical attributes ===\nDhruva is a young adult who started his crime fighting career at a young age of 14. He is probably the youngest amongst all Raj comics superheroes. He is not really bulky, muscular or heavily built. Instead, he has an athletic, flexible and strong body. Although Spanish writer Chris Wright opined that the character \"has the most pronounced calf muscles of any superhero\".The following are the vital statistics of the character as of 18 June 2007 as described on Raj Comics official website:\nAge : 23yrs\nHair : Black\nEyes : Black\nHeight : 6'\nWeight : 78 kg\n\n\n=== Personality traits ===\nDhruva comes out as a humble, gentle and down to earth kind of personality. He is very soft-spoken and mild-mannered guy who respects his elders. He is always well dressed with buttoned collar and sports well kept hairs.\nAnupam Sinha knew that being a hero with no superpowers and no alter ego, Dhruva was probably the closest thing to reality in a world of comic book superheroes, a character that children could relate to, a character that children could try to emulate. Sinha wanted Dhruva to become a role model for the kids. He wanted to show the kids that one can be tough as well as well mannered at the same time. In Sinha's words: \"I wanted to show that a well behaved and well brought up child should not fear being called a wimp.\"Sinha also gave Dhruva a very 'morally correct' image. Dhruva has been shown to have utmost respect for human life and has vowed not to take a human life ever. Dhruva never takes law in his hands and always works in conjunction with the law enforcing bodies. He believes that as a protector of the city of Rajnagar, his only job is to catch the criminal alive and hand him over to the police and the court shall decide the punishment for the criminal. As a result, there is always an air of uneasiness between Dhruva and some of his allies including Black Cat and Doga who don't think twice before killing a criminal, and he always makes it a point not to let them take the law in their hands in front of his eyes. Dhruva also doesn't hit a woman in principle.  Even while facing a female enemy, he tries to disarm her without actually hitting or inflicting physical harm to her. Dhruva received such strong moral codes from his biological parents during his childhood and subsequently during his adolescence from his foster parents.\nDhruva has also been shown to be a man of his words and a one-woman man. Though lot of girls swoon on him including his very close friend Richa (Black Cat), who loves him very deeply, Dhruva has always made it very clear to her that his heart belongs only to Natasha, his first love.\nInside this tough superhero exterior, Dhruva has a sense of humor too. Dhruva often indulges in healthy sibling rivalry, leg-pulling and playing pranks with his foster-sister Shweta and loves his foster family very much.\nDhruva has never been shown to be a drinker or a smoker. Dhruva has been shown to be a non-vegetarian, or at at least an eggetarian. This can be testified by the comic strip of page no. 5 of a comic named Grandmaster Robo (Issue No. 16 & Special Issue No. 2). The strip displays a thoughtful Dhruva mistakenly adding salt to Halua instead of boiled eggs.\n\n\n== Powers, abilities and resources ==\nDhruva has no inherent superhuman powers. His only supernatural power seems to be the ability to communicate with most animals and birds which he learned in his childhood, while growing up in Jupiter circus, playing with circus's pet animals. He can communicate with various animals ranging from a dog to a lion and most birds. The only animal that he can not communicate with is a gorilla, as shown in \"Bahri Maut\". Dhruva can also communicate with dolphins, an art taught to him by Anna, who used to conduct dolphin shows in Jupiter circus. These animals often help Dhruva in various tasks ranging from transportation, reporting him of an occurrence of a crime in front of their eyes to even assisting him in his fights.\nAnother supernatural power acquired by Dhruva is the ability to breathe and talk inside water. Dhruva received this power as a gift from his good friend Dhananjay, a resident of Swarna Nagri, an underwater city located on the seabed not very far from Indian sea shores, which is home to Swarna Manavas, the descendants/bloodline of Gods. Their technology is far more advanced as compared to humans which allowed Dhananjay to fit a chip inside Dhruva's neck by a short surgical procedure, there by providing Dhruva the ability to speak and breathe inside water.\nAlthough Dhruva does not possess any inherent superpowers, he makes up for it with his detective skills, scientific knowledge and acrobatics and martial art skills. Dhruva is known to possess a high level intellect. His deductive reasoning and lateral thinking combined with his presence of mind and scientific knowledge regarding laws of physics allow him to make innovative use of harmless objects lying around to defeat his enemies. Spanish columnist Wright noted that Dhruva \"has a MacGyver-like ability to use a paper clip or soup spoon to defeat enemies\".  Dhruva has been shown as the most intelligent and knowledgeable amongst all superheroes of Raj comics universe. He is a master strategist and tactician. In crossovers, the other superheroes make use of their superpowers according to Dhruva's plans to defeat powerful enemies. He is also a master escapologist. In 'Commando Force', Black Cat compares him to Houdini, while Nagraj once trapped in an enemy's trap wonders, \"What would have Dhruva done, had he been in my place?\" to get inspirational idea.\nDhruva is physically very strong. He received strength training from Hercules, circus's strongman. He is also adept at trapeze, balancing and other acrobatic arts that he learned from his own parents. His body has great flexibility and great reflexes, so much so that he can even dodge bullets. He is expert in most forms of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat techniques. He is also expert in free running and has been shown to jump, climb and swing through various obstacles and skyscrapers to chase down his enemies. He is an excellent marksman, thanks to the training he received from circus's knife throwing expert Ranjan and shooting expert Sulaiman. Though Dhruva despises firearms in principle, he makes good use of his marksmanship while using his star blades (Dhruva's personalised shurikens) to disarm or injure his enemy. Dhruva can even hit a target or fight an enemy blind-folded by judging the faint noises of their movements.\nDhruva is an expert biker and stunter. He learned stunt motorcycling from motorcyclist Pawan, who used to display his wall of death stunts in Jupiter Circus. Dhruva is so adept at controlling and balancing his bike that it is famously said that Dhruva's bike is nothing but a part of his body. Dhruva has been shown to have received special permission from Road Traffic department so that the traffic restrictions including traffic signals, one way, overtaking prohibition, speed limits and other such restrictions that can hamper his duties don't apply to him. Dhruva is also a licensed pilot and flies his own aircraft/jets throughout the world.\nDhruva's greatest strength is his unparalleled willpower that keeps him going in toughest of circumstances. He has been shown to possess the greatest willpower known to mankind.  His indomitable will makes him rather immune from mind control, hypnosis and other mind tricks employed by his enemies possessing psychic powers. Such attacks rarely work on him, and when they do, Dhruva quickly manages to come out of their effect. Dhruva has also developed the ability to hold his breath for 20mins. which helps him against poisonous gas attacks.\nDhruva is also the founder and captain of a government approved crime fighting organisation \"Commando Force\", which has earned Dhruva the titles such as Captain Dhruva and Super Commando. Dhruva is also a master of disguise and has made full use of his talent in titles such as 'Lahu Ke Pyase' and 'Nagadheesh'. Dhruva has always had full support of the police department and full access to all police records and classified documents, not only because his foster father Rajan Mehra is the Inspector General of Police but also because Dhruva has always had utmost respect for the law enforcing bodies and has never taken law in his hands. Later, being a member of Brahmand Rakshak, Dhruva, along with all the other members of the team, was honorarily awarded the powers and rights equivalent to a Commissioner of Police.\n\n\n=== Costume ===\nDhruva used to wear a yellow leotard over blue full body spandex bodysuit, a brown belt with a star shaped buckle and a pair of brown shoes while performing for Jupiter circus as a 14yr old. After the Jupiter circus carnage, when Dhruva started his fight against crime and evil, he continued wearing the same circus costume. Later, his belt was converted into a utility belt in which he could carry many useful items. Dhruva does not wear any cape, mask or helmet. Instead, as Wright pointed out, he prefers to sport a \"solid-looking helmet of hair\".Sinha made the first and the only major overhaul till date in the character's attire ten years later in 1998. In the title 'Dhruva-shakti', Dhruva's sister Shweta, a budding scientist, gave him some assortments that included a metallic bracelet each for both his hands. While the right bracelet had a cartridge of star blades, the left had a cartridge of star-line. Dhruva could shoot either of them with just a pull of a lever as against the older days when he had to take them out of his belt pocket and then throw them manually. She also gave him a metallic utility belt as against the older leather one with a star buckle with built-in star-transmitter and a built-in locking system so that no one could cut or pull his belt off from his waist. She also gave him a metallic holding strap for his boots and a wheel cover with push-back wheels that would convert his boots into roller skates with the flip of a switch.\nApart from this, Dhruva's appearance remained unchanged throughout the years. Although Nagayana, the futuristic series set in alternate universe, allowed Sinha to experiment with Dhruva's looks.\n\n\n=== Equipment ===\nDhruva is not really into too much high tech gadgetry. Whatever little equipments he makes use of, most of them have the word 'star-' prefixed to them, which gives it a slight campy feel. Four things that really define the character are star-blades, star-line, utility belt and Dhruva's special motorbike.\nStar-blade is Dhruva's personalised shuriken like razor sharp weapon. Although potentially lethal, Dhruva rarely uses them in a lethal way. Mostly Dhruva uses his star-blades to disarm his enemy or cut something. Dhruva shoots star-blades from his right hand bracelet. Star-line, on the other hand, is a thin rope made of nylo-steel which can not be cut, burnt or broken easily. Star-line is attached to a star-shaped grappling hook at one end. Dhruva uses his left hand bracelet, which contains star-line, like a grapple gun and can climb up or swing from one skyscraper to another like Batman. Dhruva mentions in one of his titles that he should meet Batman someday and thank him personally for inventing this style which is very handy especially in case of traffic jams. He also uses star-line to trip or tie up his enemy.\nDhruva's preferred mode of transport is his special motorbike. The bike is specially designed and optimised to suit his needs. Dhruva's bike is remote control enabled, so that he can start and operate his bike even from a distance. Dhruva's bike has undergone innumerable design changes from the old fashioned 1980s design to a modernised sports bike look. Among all designs one common factor has been that the bike never had any attached firearm to it. It is said that the sound of the engine of Dhruva's bike is unique and different from any other bike and can be easily identified. Dhruva also owns a star helicopter, a star plane (a literally star shaped plane painted half blue and half yellow), a sonic jet and a star-boat. The only significant omission from Dhruva's fleet of transport vehicles is a car which he has never owned.\nStar-blade, star-line and motorbike are so significant to the character's identity that often, even before Dhruva himself breaks into a crime scene, a flurry of star-blades, a star-line or the sound of Dhruva's special bike announce the arrival of Dhruva.\n\n\n==== Utility belt ====\nDhruva's utility belt is one of the most significant and defining characteristic of the character's appearance as well the character's most useful and important tool in his crime fighting sojourn. Dhruva's belt has evolved over the years from a simple leather belt to a leather utility belt with pouches to a metallic utility belt. In its current version, Dhruva's utility belt is a metallic belt with inbuilt locking system to make sure that no one can easily pull it off or cut it as against his older leather belt. The star shaped buckle has an inbuilt transmitter which enables Dhruva to stay in contact with commando headquarters, police force and even some of his allies including Chandika. Dhruva is known to carry a lot of utility items in his belt pockets. The various items that he has been shown to carry in his utility belt at various times include, but are not limited to, spare cartridges for star-blades and star-lines, acid capsules, signal flares, star cuffs (star shaped handcuffs), a make-up kit and many more items. Dhruva also carries a special transmitter fixed at 'Brahmand Rakshak' frequency which enables him to stay in contact with the Brahmand Rakshak headquarters as well as the other members of Brahmand Rakshak team. On some occasions he has been shown to carry a separate Brahmand Rakshak transmitter while on the other occasions it has been shown to be integrated with Dhruva's personal star-transmitter. Dhruva also carries a radiation sensor which is either fitted in his collar button or sometimes in his belt and blinks whenever there is threat of hazardous level of radiation exposure.\n\n\n=== Commando headquarters ===\nCommando headquarters is the base of Commando Force located in Rajnagar. It is the place from where Commando Force operates. It is equipped with state of the art technology and computer system. Its system can perform various functions that include, but are not limited to, facial recognition, finger print matching, DNA matching, remote hacking of enemy's system and global surveillance through satellite imaging. Commando headquarters' system also keeps the data on every criminal, can access police records as well Interpol files on request. Teenagers residing in various cities of India receive special training at the headquarters from the Commando Force and then sent back to their respective homes. These trained junior cadets have special protocol to report any ongoing crime to commando headquarters and not getting involved themselves unless they are sure they can handle it. Dhruva has got surveillance cameras installed all over Rajnagar streets which are monitored at the headquarters for suspicious activities. Information on any suspicious activity caught by cameras or junior cadets, if requiring Dhruva's attention, is channelled to Dhruva on his star-transmitter. Dhruva himself patrols the city streets every night on his special motorbike. Dhruva's unyielding dedication towards keeping his city safe has earned him the title of 'Rajnagar Ka Rakhwala' (Keeper of Rajnagar).\n\n\n== Supporting characters ==\n\nDhruva has a large range of supporting characters who have played significant roles in his story arcs. While some help to define the character of Super Commando Dhruva itself, other have played significant roles in giving a direction to the story arcs that they have been part of. After the death of Dhruva' parents, I. G. Rajan Mehra adopted him. I. G. Rajan has been a constant presence in Dhruva titles and has been very useful not only as the chief of police but also as a father-figure and a constant source of inspiration. When a supervillain Alchemist almost forced Dhruva into retirement by endangering his family's life by targeting Rajan Mehra and Dhruva's sister Shweta, it was Dhruva's father who motivated him to keep going.\nDhruva's Commando Force, a team of three trained cadets (Peter Massy, Karim Shah and Renu) has been another important support for him in his fight. Dhananjay, the descendant of Gods, is Dhruva's most powerful ally and a good friend who not only provided him with the power to breathe inside water but is also ready to help whenever Dhruva needs him and vice versa. But amongst a long list of supporting characters in Dhruva series, the most important character has been Shweta, Dhruva's sister. She has been the strongest pillar of support in Dhruva's constant battle against evil on many levels. As a little sister, she engages with Dhruva in funny sibling banter, cheers him up and makes sure he never feels sad or misses his biological family. As a budding scientist, she constantly provides Dhruva with innovative gadgets that prove very helpful to Dhruva during his fights. But the highest level of support she provides is in the form of Chandika, a blonde super heroine, her alter ego. Chandika has inherited her brother's fighting style. Like Dhruva, she too depends on brains more than brawn as well as on her self-invented gadgets. She is always there to help Dhruva whenever he is in danger. Dhruva who is very protective about her sister, under strong suspicion that Shweta is in fact Chandika, often reprimands her for putting her life in danger. But Shweta somehow manages to come out clean every time proving that she is not Chandika. Natasha is the only person who knows Chandika's true identity. Shweta eventually went to London in 2007 Makadjaal series to pursue her further studies. In Nagayana, when Shweta was presumably dead, although later revived, Natasha kept Chandika alive by donning her costume.\nDhruva has had quite a few love interests that include Natasha, Richa and Sabby. Natasha is Dhruva's arch enemy Grand Master Robo's daughter. While Natasha and Dhruva's love is mutual, Richa and Sabby's love is more one sided. Sabby is the daughter of another terrorist Abbu Salem. She never reappeared since her first appearance in 'Sarvanash'. On the other hand, Richa has been an integral part of Dhruva's storyline ever since her first appearance. As Richa, she has been Dhruva's best friend and as her alter ego Black Cat, a lethal superheroine with killer instincts, though initially rogue who later turned to the good side, she has been a partner and helper in many of Dhruva's fights. More so since Chandika (Shweta) has gone out of India to pursue her studies. In alternate universe shown in Nagayana series, Natasha has been revealed to be the lawfully wedded wife of Dhruva. Both have a conceived a kid out of their marriage as well. Richa too bears Dhruva's child though as she pointed out, Dhruva never cheated on Natasha as his and Richa's baby was borne out of IVF technique.\nOther significant supporting characters in Dhruva series include Jingalu, a yeti; Kirigi, a ninja fighter with yogic powers; Lori, a tantric; Vanputra who has the ability to communicate with plants and trees in contrast to Dhruva who communicates with animals; Barf-manava, possessing the power of ice; Saamri, the keeper of Jwalok, a secret city located inside a volcano; Vera Vicet, a French police officer who initially tried to kill Dhruva under the impression that Shyam, Dhruva's biological father, had killed her father but eventually realised the truth and became his ally and Nakshatra, a mirror image of Dhruva who, like Dhruva, was born and brought up in a circus and has pretty much the same abilities that Dhruva has. As opposed to Vera, Nakshatra tried to kill Dhruva's father I. G. Rajan believing that Rajan had murdered his father in a fake encounter but upon realising the truth, he surrendered to the police and when he came out after serving his jail sentence, he eventually became Dhruva's friend. In Nagayana, Nakshatra has been shown to be Shweta's love interest.\nDhruva has been a member of superhero team Brahmand Rakshak. Dhruva has often teamed up with other superheroes, most frequently with Nagraj and occasionally with Doga. While Nagraj and Dhruva have grown to become thick of friends over the years, Dhruva-Doga relationship is a bit more tense because of differing moral codes and sense of justice of the two heroes.\n\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\nDhruva has his own rogues gallery filled with an assortment of villains that includes common criminals without any superpowers, supervillains, devils and even extraterrestrial beings. Dhruva's biggest arch enemy and the most recurring villain in his titles is Grand Master Robo, a crime lord. Half human, half robot, Robo has a laser eye fit inside his left eyeball. Over the years Robo and Dhruva have developed a strange bond of hatred and respect. While Dhruva wants to arrest Robo, and Robo wants to kill Dhruva who always foils his plans, they also acknowledge the fact that if any of them hurts the other, it would eventually hurt Natasha, Robo's daughter and Dhruva's love interest.\nOther arch foes of Dhruva include Chandakaal, the last remaining demon on earth; Mahamanav, a highly evolved version of Homo sapiens with psychic superpowers; Dhawaniraj, a mad scientist whose power is lethal forms of sound waves; Dr. Virus, a biologist; Bauna Waman, a midget who uses toys as his weapons and Chumba, who possesses the power of magnetism.\nDhruva has always believed in giving criminals a chance to redeem themselves. Natasha, Nakshatra, Nostredamas and Black Cat are classic examples of rogues turning good by Dhruva effect. Robo himself had a near change of heart but Natasha who had gone rogue because of rampaging corruption in the system, prevented him from surrendering. In 'Vinash', Dhruva convinced his foes to work with him as a team to protect earth from a far greater danger. Dhruva has even fought against his best friend Nagraj when he went rogue.\nOver the years Dhruva has come to gain the respect of his enemies as well especially the ones with great superpowers like Chandakaal and Mahamanav. In  'Jaljala', when Mahamanav sets out to kill every superhero, while he sent out his pawns to kill other heroes, he decided to kill Dhruva with his own hands considering him a prized cache. In 'Soorma', Dr. Virus who takes on Nagraj and Parmanu states that he had to shift his base from Rajnagar to Delhi for the fear of Dhruva. Chumba himself mentioned once that Dhruva scares him in his dreams. One common thing Dhruva's villains have acknowledged on separate occasions is that Dhruva is probably the most dangerous superhero because unlike most other heroes who depend on their superpowers, he doesn't possess any weakness to exploit and they cannot anticipate what plan Dhruva's mind can come up with.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\n\n=== Merchandising ===\nIn the early part of the 1990s, Raj comics was very popular. They tried to encash their characters' popularity by a series of merchandising. These merchandise included stickers, magnet stickers, tattoos, posters, trading cards, wallets, T-shirts, dinner plates, jigsaw puzzles, face masks and stationery items themed on their superhero characters including Dhruva under a common trade name 'Nagraj Novelties'. The merchandise did not become very popular and eventually went out of production because of various reasons including lack of marketing, not licensing their characters to other more established merchandising companies and instead keeping the rights to themselves and not making these merchandise widely available in the open market all over India through distributorship. Many years later, around 2010, with the advent of online shopping and payment options, Raj comics again tried to venture into the merchandising business which primarily included posters, calendars and T-shirts.\n\n\n=== Critical reception and popularity ===\nSuper Commando Dhruva became a very popular character soon after his introduction in Indian comics. Apart from being popular among kids, even girls (owing to his smart looks), Dhruva also received positive reviews from parents for having a strong moral code, educative science/detective-based themes and having minimal violence. Dhruva went on to become one of the most loved character in Indian comics as evident by unofficial online polls on various fan sites. The character's fans fondly address him as Captain and call themselves his cadets.  Anupam Sinha mentioned on his Facebook wall in Feb 2012 referencing to Dhruva's popularity and his debut title, \"the first book of my most successful character yet, which I made 25 years ago is still in print and sells! Thank you God for everything!\"In 2013, Raj comics published a list of Top 20 best sellers titles on their official Facebook page based on the sales figures on their own online store and Flipkart. While 6 of them were Dhruva's solo titles, the remaining 14 were multi-hero/crossover titles featuring Dhruva as one of the leading character, thereby making him the most popular Raj comic superhero.\nIn November 2020, a poll was conducted on the official new Facebook page of 'Raj Comics by Sanjay Gupta'.  As an outcome, Dhruva not just secured the first place as the most loved Raj Comics character but also the popularity of Dhruva's alone came close to the popularity of all other characters combined.\nAlthough hugely popular in Hindi speaking states of India and the Indians living abroad, the character hardly got any recognition internationally as well as in non-Hindi-speaking regions of South India. In 2009, for the first time Raj Comics opened stores in Karnataka, one of the non-Hindi speaking states of South India, giving them a taste of Indian Hindi comics. Dhruva has also slowly made his presence felt in the international arena as well. In August 2011, The Boston Globe ran a feature on non-American comic book superheroes. They analysed comic book superheroes belonging to seven different nationalities which included Captain Canuck of Canada, Eden Fesi of Australia, Super Inframan of China, Zooman: El Hombre Mosca - a Mexican superhero, Superboy - a French superhero, Jabbar-The Powerful of Saudi Arab and Dhruva representing Indian comics. Not only did the character receive positive reviews from the columnist, but he also rated Dhruva the highest among the seven heroes awarding him a rating of 8 out of 10. Spanish writer Chris Wright summed up the review for Dhruva - \"It's hard to find fault with Super Commando Dhruva - he is completely nuts in the best possible way.\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlternative versions of Dhruva\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDhruva's fan club at Yahoo!

        "article": "Ata-ur-Rehman (Urdu: \u0639\u0637\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646\u200e; born 28 March 1975) is a Pakistani cricketer who played in 13 Test matches and 30 One Day International (ODIs) between 1992 and 1996. He is tall and well built, bowling right-arm fast medium with a good control of line and length and the ability to move the old ball. He made his international debut for Pakistan on their 1992 tour of England when aged only 17. His last appearance for Pakistan came in an ODIs against England at Edgbaston on 31 August 1996.\n\n\n== Match fixing allegations and the Qayyum Commission ==\nIn 1998 Ata-ur-Rehman claimed that Wasim Akram had paid him 100,000 Pakistani rupees to bowl badly in a one-day match held at Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 1994.At Justice Malik Qayyum's Commission into match-fixing, Ata-ur-Rehman initially denied that he had made the allegations against Wasim Akram. However, when the statement was produced he changed his story and in camera confirmed the affidavit he had previously given. He had met Wasim Akram in England and maintained that he was threatened with dire consequences, leading him to change his story and sign a second affidavit in London. He also said that Khalid Mahmood, Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, asked him to retract his statement. Under cross examination, however, Ata-ur-Rehman retracted his statement made against Wasim Akram and said that the allegation of match fixing was false.As a result of the Qayyum Commission Ata-ur-Rehman was proceeded against for perjury and when it published its report in 2000 the Commission recommended that he be banned from international cricket, further finding that the evidence against Wasim Akram has not reached what it called \"the requisite level\", primarily because Ata-ur-Rehman had perjured himself.Some reports suggest that the feeling persisted that Ata-ur-Rehman and the former Pakistan captain Salim Malik, who was also banned on the recommendation on the Commission, had 'taken the fall' for match fixing because they were expendable. Ata-ur-Rehman had not played internationally since 1996 and Salim Malik was by then 37 years old. Qayyum himself subsequently suggested that his \"soft corner\" for Wasim Akram might have influenced him when handing the former Pakistan captain his punishment.\n\n\n== Subsequent career ==\nAta-ur-Rehman's life ban was lifted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in November 2006.Ata represented Derbyshire in four Second XI Championship matches during 2007 while looking to resurrect his career in county cricket. He spent the 2009 season playing for Widnes in the Cheshire County Cricket League. He also played for hem health forsook in 2010 where he showed a very competitive spirit scoring plenty of runs, and taking a lot of wickets.\nIn 2004, he was running a sports goods shop in Lahore.On 11 June 2013, Ata signed a deal with Nottinghamshire Premier League side the West Indian Cavaliers, signing on until the end of the season. In March 2014 Ata joined Kearsley Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League in Lancashire, a club he had previously represented as a professional some years earlier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAta-ur-Rehman at ESPNcricinfo"

He was a member of the ICC Elite Umpire Panel from 2006 to 2013, and is alleged to have been involved in match-fixing and spot-fixing of cricket matches. In February 2016, Rauf was found guilty of corruption by the BCCI and banned for five years.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nRauf played in Pakistani domestic cricket between 1977 and 1991, representing Pakistan Universities, Lahore, National Bank of Pakistan and Pakistan Railways.\n\n\n== Umpiring career ==\nRauf became a first-class umpire in 1998.

After being dropped from the ICC Elite Panel of Umpires he resigned from being an umpire anymore.\n\n\n=== 2013 IPL spot-fixing ===\nAsad Rauf's name cropped up during the 2013 IPL spot fixing controversy and the ICC reacted immediately by withdrawing him from the panel of match officials for the 2013 Champions Trophy.Rauf was charged by Mumbai Police on 21 September 2013 in a Mumbai Court with illegal betting, cheating and fraud. Rauf has denied the allegations but refused to go to Mumbai to face the charges.

He married Matilda Lewis (d. 1921), daughter of Dr Sigismund Lewis of Liverpool, who had also emigrated from Germany. Dr Lewis delivered his grandson after a difficult birth; Matilda recovered well but Julien would be an only child.Julien grew up in a strict  Orthodox household in Nottingham, where his father opened the Nottingham Furnishing Company in 1885. Albert was very active in the Nottingham Jewish community, becoming the president of the Chaucer Street synagogue and Hebrew Philanthropic Society.Julien attended primary school with Harold Bowden, later the 2nd Baronet, and the two became lifelong friends.Cahn married Phyllis Muriel Wolfe on 11 July 1916. They had three children, Patience Cahn (born 1922), Albert Jonas (1924) and Richard Ian (1927). Albert Jonas assumed the baronetcy on his father's death.\n\n\n== Business ==\nCahn took over the family business and, seeing a new potential market in hire purchase sales, expanded the company to the extent that his Jays and Campbells stores were to be found in most major towns across Britain. By 1943 when he retired and sold out to Great Universal Stores (GUS), he controlled a chain more than 300 stores.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nAfter his business success, Cahn established himself as a philanthropist. Having been knighted in 1929, Cahn was made a baronet in 1934. The honour was made ostensibly for his charity and services to agriculture. However, it was actually bestowed for secretly providing \u00a330,000 to the Conservative Government to ensure honours salesman Maundy Gregory stayed out of Britain.One of his most-well known gifts was his rescue of the Newstead Abbey, the 12th-century ancestral home of Lord Byron, which was at risk. Cahn purchased Newstead and donated it to the Nottingham City Council to help preserve Byron's legacy.Cahn was the long-time president of The National Birthday Trust Fund, a charity that promoted the provision of maternity services. In this capacity he became very friendly with the trust's vice president, Lucy Baldwin, Countess Baldwin of Bewdley, wife of prime minister Stanley Baldwin.\nIn 1929, Cahn donated funds to build the Lucy Baldwin Maternity Hospital in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire, named in honour of the countess. It was commemorated by the prime minister on 16 April 1929 with a bronze dedication plaque over the main entrance reading, \"What she wanted most in the world. Presented to her by Julien Cahn Esq.\"During the Great Depression and Second World War, Cahn sponsored cricket clubs and players that needed funds to play. In 1935, Cahn paid the membership subscriptions for more than 800 new members joining the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club.After the war began in 1939, Cahn lent his home at Stanford Hall to Nottingham City Hospital. Stanford Hall initially offered 22 beds for convalescing soldiers, but by 1940 expanded to house nearly 70.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nCahn was an avid fan of fox hunting, and was one of the few Jewish Masters of Foxhounds.His main love, however, was cricket. He began playing as a teenager, during a time when it was common for business owners to organise teams. At age 19, he created the Nottingham Furniture Company XI with 16 of his father's employees. In 1903, the team expanded to 35 players for its third season, and was renamed the Notts Ramblers.One of the earliest players was W. H. Vaulkhard, who joined the team in 1904; his four sons also took up the sport and played on Cahn's teams. Pat Vaulkhard became a first-class player in his day.\nHe served as president of both the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and Leicestershire County Cricket Club. He eventually built his own pitch at Stanford Hall so he could watch games at home.From 1929 to 1939, Cahn was the captain of his own team, the Sir Julien Cahn XI, that toured the world. It was one of the most successful private teams, losing only 19 out of 621 cricket matches. Cahn recruited top players from outside England, including Australians Vic Jackson and Jack Walsh.Cahn played in many of his team's matches, including six of the 13 first-class matches they played between 1929 and 1939. He made his first-class debut in March 1929 at the age of 46 when his team was playing in Jamaica. Stephen Chalke has written, \"No English first-class cricketer of the 20th century can have had less ability than Cahn. He was a hypochondriac, often preferring his electric wheelchair to walking ... he batted in special inflatable pads that it was his chauffeur's duty to pump up.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSir Julien Cahn's XI cricket team in Ceylon in 1936\u201337, international tour\nSir Julien Cahn's XI cricket team in New Zealand in 1938\u201339, international tour\nStanford Hall\nHistory of cricket\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Robert \"Long Robin\" Colchin (1713 \u2013 c. 27 April 1750) was a highly influential professional English cricketer and match organiser of the mid-Georgian period at a time when the single wicket version of the game was popular. He was born at Chailey, East Sussex and died at Deptford.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nColchin lived in Bromley for several years and was associated with the local Bromley Cricket Club, which was prominent through the 1740s and declined after his death. In addition to his prowess as a single wicket player, Colchin played for Kent in top-class eleven-a-side matches including the famous match against England at the Artillery Ground in 1744. Colchin had strong associations with the Artillery Ground and is known to have promoted many matches there, often fielding his own team under the name of Long Robin's XI.\n\n\n== Style and technique ==\nColchin was an accomplished single wicket performer. He is held to have been probably the finest all-round player of his day and was called \"Long Robin\" because he was so tall: \"And Robin, from his size, surnamed the Long\". According to a contemporary article about Colchin in The Connoisseur (no. 132, dated 1746): \"his greatest excellence is cricket-playing, in which he is reckoned as good a bat as either of the Bennetts; and is at length arrived at the supreme dignity of being distinguished among his breathren of the wicket by the title of Long Robin\".\n\n\n== Family and personal life ==\nAccording to The Connoisseur, Colchin's favourite amusement was attending the executions at Tyburn. He had been \"born and bred a gentleman, but has taken great pains to degrade himself, and is now as complete a blackguard as those whom he has chosen for his companions\". The companions are said to include \"the vulgar\" among whom Colchin \"has cultivated an intimacy with Buckhorse (i.e., John Smith, a noted prizefighter), and is very proud of being sometimes admitted to the honour of conversing with the great Broughton himself (Jack Broughton was probably the most famous prizefighter of the 18th century)\".Colchin died in the last few days of April 1750, aged 36 or 37. He had taken part in an athletics race on 9 April and a contemporary report said he developed a \"surfeit\" doing that \"which threw him into the Small-Pox\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAshley-Cooper, F.

        "article": "Alfred Mynn (19 January 1807 \u2013 1 November 1861) was an English first-class cricketer during the game's \"Roundarm Era\". He was a genuine all-rounder, being both an attacking right-handed batsman and a formidable right arm fast bowler. Cricket writer John Woodcock ranked him as the fourth greatest cricketer of all time. Simon Wilde wrote of him: \"The speed at which Mynn bowled... and his life-size personality captured the imagination of the public in a way no cricketer had before.\"Mynn was born at Twisden, near Goudhurst in Kent, the fourth son of a gentleman farmer. He was a hop farmer, and was married to Sarah, in 1828. They had many children, five of his daughters survived to adulthood and Sarah Mynn outlived her husband by twenty years.\nHe was a very large man by any standard, bearing comparison with W. G. Grace. He was well over six feet tall and weighed more than 21 stones (294 lbs). He was known as \"the Lion of Kent\" and it was for Kent that most of his greatest feats occurred, though he also played a substantial number of matches for Sussex, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the All-England Eleven (AEE). His brother, Walter Mynn, was also an early cricketer with the Kent team.Mynn's first-class career was from 1832 to 1859. He played in 213 first-class matches. As a batsman he had 395 innings. He scored 4,955 runs at a batting average of 13.42 runs per innings with a highest score of 125 not out. He made only one century, scored for South v North at Leicester in 1836. As a bowler he was fast with a round arm action. With his arm never getting above shoulder height he was obliged to bowl around the wicket.\nFred Gale in \"Echoes from old Cricket Fields\" (Simpkin and Marshall 1871), wrote\n\"I must see another man who stands six-foot two, of gigantic but symmetrical figure, standing up his full height, taking six stately steps to the wicket, and bringing his arm round well below the shoulder, and sending the ball down like a flash of lightning dead on the wicket, before I can ever believe there is or has been a greater cricketer than Alfred Mynn\".\nMynn suffered an ankle injury before the famous 1836 match. He batted with a runner and was unable to bowl. Leg guards had not yet been invented and as he made his hundred in the second innings his legs were badly bruised by the Northern fast bowler Sam Redgate. Mynn's captain, Lord Frederick Beauclerk sent him back to London laid out on the top of a stagecoach.\nDr Bainbridge of St Martin's Lane and Surgeon Lawrence attended him at the Angel Tavern and debated whether his leg should be amputated. When told he would lose his leg at the hip, Mynn, a sincerely religious man, asked for a few minutes to say his prayers. In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.After this injury there is some evidence that Mynn wore padding on his game leg. There is no conclusive evidence that he invented leg guards as worn by modern cricketers although there was an anecdote about WG Grace being presented with a pair of Mynn's pads and using them in a match. This story dates from Fred Gale's book \"The Game of Cricket\" (1887), published many years after the end of Mynn's career.\nMynn's finances were never sound. He played as an amateur and a gentleman and risked social disgrace each time he accepted money for playing. He was imprisoned several times for debts owed to John Wyatt, a money lender, in 1845. He was made bankrupt in that year. Often he was saved from his creditors by wealthy patrons who wanted him free to play in a match they had an interest in. It is possible he had extensive medical bills to settle after the injury to his leg. The situation was eased in 1847, by the award of a testimonial match at Lord's between Kent and \"England\".\nMynn was also an enthusiastic amateur actor, appearing for the Old Stagers during Canterbury Cricket Week. He took regular minor roles from 1847 until his death. He generally played strongmen such as Hercules. In 1853 the Kentish Gazette noted his appearance as \"The Grand German Water Drinker\" when he imbibed \"no less than 12 tumblers of water in as many half minutes.\"\nHe died suddenly at his brother Walter's house at 22 Merrick Square, Newington near Southwark, London. The cause of death was diabetes. As a member of the Leeds and Hollingbourne Volunteers, a rifle corps which was a forerunner of the Territorial Army, he was entitled to a military funeral. He is buried in Thurnham churchyard next to two of his daughters.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nWilliam Jeffrey Prowse wrote what was to become one of the most famous pieces of cricket poetry in his memory. The first six stanzas compare Mynn with his contemporaries. The poem closes with these lines:\n\nWith his tall and stately presence, with his nobly moulded form,\nHis broad hand was ever open, his brave heart was ever warm;\nAll were proud of him, all loved him. As the changing seasons pass,\nAs our champion lies a-sleeping underneath the Kentish grass,\nProudly, sadly will we name him \u2013 to forget him were a sin.\nLightly lie the turf upon thee, kind and manly Alfred Mynn!Mynn is commemorated in Bearsted Kent, where the house in which he lived, Mount Pleasant, can be found. The village sign is a depiction of him, and the local pub, The Lion of Kent, is named after him.He is a fictional character in the historical novel Flashman's Lady. The main character Harry Flashman plays cricket with him several times.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlfred Mynn at ESPNcricinfo\n\"Alfred Mynn \u2013 the mighty man of rustic Kent\", Cricinfo, 13 September 1963\n\"Mynn's majestic innings \u2013 and the birth of leg-guards\", Cricinfo, 18 December 2004"

        "article": "Paul Lee Harris (born 2 November 1978) is a Zimbabwean born former South African cricketer who played Test cricket as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler for the South African team between 2007 and 2011. He has also played domestic cricket for Northerns, Titans, Western Province and Warwickshire.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHarris was born at Salisbury in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) where his father Mark was a member of the British South Africa Police until 1980. As a young child he moved with his family to South Africa and was brought up in Fish Hoek, Cape Town, South Africa. His father is a pastor in the Fish Hoek area.Harris lives in Olympus, Pretoria with his wife Marilet.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nWhile playing for Fish Hoek High School Harris was spotted by Western Province coach Duncan Fletcher who brought him into the provincial underage system. At Western Province Harris played alongside then-future England player Jonathan Trott.Harris made his first-class cricket debut for Western Province B in 1998 in an UCB Bowl match against Eastern Province B in Port Elizabeth. It took over two years for Harris to play another first-class match. Due to intense competition for spinning roles, with Paul Adams and Claude Henderson being preferred over Harris, he only played two matches for Western Province, in March 2001 and February 2002.After the 2001\u201302 cricket season, Harris transferred to Northerns. With the restructuring of South African domestic cricket in 2004 Harris played for the Titans in the SuperSport Series while continuing to play occasionally for Northerns in the South African Airways Provincial Challenges.During the 2006 English cricket season, he joined Warwickshire under the Kolpak ruling after New Zealand spinner Daniel Vettori was injured. He immediately made his debut for the Bears in a Twenty20 Cup match against Worcestershire. He formed a spin bowling partnership with off-spinner Alex Loudon. After representing South Africa internationally he became ineligible to play as a Kolpak ruling player for Warwickshire.\n\n\n=== International cricket ===\nFollowing the retirement from international cricket of fellow spinner Nicky Boje in late 2006, he was given his first call-up for South Africa after Claude Henderson made himself unavailable. He played his first match in the third Test of the 2006\u201307 South Africa-India series against India at Newlands Cricket Ground. His career was off to an eventful start, taking four wickets in the first innings including the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar and is widely considered the best spinner for the Proteas since re-admission. \nHarris began to show some more promise on the tour to Pakistan in October and November 2007 taking 12 wickets at an average of 20.66 including best figures of 5\u201373 in the first Test in Karachi.\n\nIn August 2007 Harris, returning to the country of his birth, led South Africa A to a win over Zimbabwe A, taking nine wickets in a man-of-the-match performance.In March 2008 Harris was selected in the South African One Day International team that toured Bangladesh. Harris played three ODI matches against Bangladesh in Chittagong, Mirpur and Dhaka.During South Africa's 2008 tour of England Harris' bowling style was derided by English commentator and former player Geoffrey Boycott as being \"buffet\" bowling. In December 2009, in response to this and other criticism of the lack of spin in his bowling, he joked that \"most people will say I\u2019ve only got the straight one\".Playing against Australia during their 2009 tour to South Africa Harris was key to ensuring a South African fightback in the third Test, taking nine wickets in the Protea's innings-and-twenty-run win. For his efforts, he was named man of the match.In the second Test against India in February 2010 Harris bowled 12 wides, the most wides in a Test innings, bowling over the wicket on team instructions.\n\n\n=== Honours ===\nHarris was named in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's 40 best players of 2007. He was named South African Newcomer of the Year in the 2007 Mutual & Federal SA Cricket Awards.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPaul Harris at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Shanthakumaran Nair Sreesanth (pronunciation , born 6 February 1983) is an Indian cricketer and film actor who played all forms of the game. He is a right-arm fast-medium-pace bowler and a right-handed tail-ender batsman. Currently in first class cricket, he plays for Kerala. He played in the Indian Premier League (IPL), played for Rajasthan Royals. He is also the first Kerala Ranji player to have played Twenty20 cricket for India. Initially banned for life after spot-fixing in the 2013 IPL, the ban was reduced to seven years in August 2019.\nAgain he is selected for Kerala cricket team in 2020 and resumes his Career in national cricket.\nIn 2018, he participated in the popular reality show, Bigg Boss and became the runner up.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSreesanth was born on 6 February 1983 to Santhakumaran Nair and Savithri Devi. He has one elder brother and two elder sisters. His brother Dipu Santhan owns a music company in Kochi and his eldest sister Nivedita is a television actress in Kerala. Sreesanth's elder sister Divya married Madhu Balakrishnan, a famous South Indian playback singer.\nOn 12 December 2013, Sreesanth married his girlfriend Bhuvneshwari Kumari of Jaipur's Shekhawat family at Guruvayur Sri Krishna temple in Kerala. Bhuvneshwari Kumari aka Nain Shekhawat is the daughter of Hirendra Singh Shekhawat and Muktha Singh.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nSreesanth initially was a leg-spinner in his childhood, modelling his action on India's leading Test wicket-taker Anil Kumble, who was to become his Test captain. However, his habit of bowling yorkers led him to convert to fast bowling, after being encouraged by his elder brother. Following in the footsteps of fellow Kerala fast bowler Tinu Yohannan, who earned selection to the National Cricket Academy in 2000, Sreesanth was selected for the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai. He then made his first-class debut against Goa in the 2002\u201303 domestic season, claiming 22 wickets in seven matches in the Ranji Trophy and winning selection for South Zone in the Duleep Trophy squad in the same season.He was selected for India-A side in a tour match against the visiting New Zealand side at Rajkot. He claimed one wicket in twelve overs after being restricted with a hamstring injury. He also missed five Ranji Trophy games in that season, although he still travelled with the side for away games. This led to rumours that an astrologer convinced him to take a break from competition to preserve his longevity in the sport, which Sreesanth categorically denied, maintaining that he was training only to regain his fitness.In November 2004, Sreesanth entered the record books when he took a hat-trick against Himachal Pradesh in a Ranji trophy game. He was selected to represent India B in the Challenger Trophy in October 2005, a domestic limited-overs tournament. He performed impressively in that tournament, earning the Man of the Series award and being the leading wicket taker (7) with the third best bowling average. This led to his selection to Indian team for the home ODI series against Sri Lanka.\n\n\n== ODI career ==\nSreesanth was given the new ball in the first ODI against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. After being punished early by Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya, Sreesanth returned to claim his first two ODI wickets at the end of the match. He was left out of the team and was later recalled for the fourth, fifth and sixth ODIs as coach Greg Chappell tinkered with the line-up. He was retained in the squad but did not play in the 5 match series against South Africa, but played all five matches in the tour to Pakistan, recording a haul of 4/58 in the fifth ODI against Pakistani cricket team in Karachi. A good home series against the England in April 2006, in which he claimed 10 wickets at an average of 16.3, including a career best 6/55 in the final match at Indore (in which he was awarded the man of the match award [2]), led to him subsequently being awarded a BCCI contract, in the C-grade in May.His disappointing economy rate led him to be left out of the ICC Champions Trophy squad of 14, with the beneficiary being R. P. Singh. He made an unexpected come back to the blue squad due to the injury to Ajit Agarkar later in the tournament. He was also out of the Indian ODI team for the England tour.\nIn the 2011 Cricket World Cup, Sreesanth was selected due to injury to Praveen Kumar. He was expensive in the first game going wicketless at 53 runs in 5 overs. He was selected in the final where he gave away 52 runs in 8 wicketless overs.\n\n\n== Test career ==\n\nSreesanth was selected for his first Test squad in the home series against England in March 2006, in place of Zaheer Khan. He claimed 4/95 in his debut appearance in the 1st Test in Nagpur, where he opened the bowling with Irfan Pathan. He was ruled out of the second Test in Mohali due to illness, but recovered and captured five wickets as well a 29* with the bat in the Third Test in Mumbai. With the axing of Pathan, Sreesanth became India's leading pace bowler on the tour of the West Indies. He missed the second Test due to an injury but managed to claim his best match figures of 5/72 in the 4th Test in Kingston, Jamaica.\n\nSreesanth's most significant performance to date in Test cricket was his role in the first Test of India's 2006 tour to South Africa at Johannesburg. After losing the limited-overs series 4\u20130, Sreesanth produced took 5\u201340 in a display of pace and swing to help dismiss South Africa. This performance helped to bowl South Africans out for just 84, leading to first Indian win on South African soil, for which he was named man of the match. Again, Sreesanth's emotional antics, which have led him to be regarded by some commentators as eccentric, were frequently noted. He was fined after breaching the International Cricket Council's advertising logo policy, and also for \"conduct contrary to the spirit of the game\" after sending off Hashim Amla after dismissing him. He was also involved in a highly publicised confrontation while batting against paceman Andr\u00e9 Nel. Nel delivered a series of fast balls at Sreesanth's upper body and after Sreesanth ungainly evaded one delivery, taunted him by gesturing to his chest, indicating that he felt Sreesanth was lacking in courage. On the next ball, Sreesanth gave him the charge and hit the ball straight over the bowler's head into the stands for a six. He then whirled his bat in enthusiasm and danced down the wicket, making fun of Nel and performing a dance. Later, Sreesanth said that he would not repeat anything of the sort, since he could be suspended for violating the code of conduct. Even though he went unpunished for the Nel incident, he was fined 30% of the match fee for running towards Hashim Amla after picking up his wicket, and wearing a branded garment under the jersey.\nSreesanth courted controversy once again during the fourth day of the second test of India's 2007 tour to England at Trent Bridge. He was fined half of his match fee for deliberately shoulder barging England captain Michael Vaughan whilst walking back to his mark. He also bowled a beamer at batsman Kevin Pietersen, which the latter had to take drastic action to avoid. Sreesanth however did immediately apologise afterwards. After the match he said that the ball had slipped from his hand. Soon afterwards, he bowled a no-ball where he overstepped the crease by roughly 2 feet (0.61 m), leading to speculation it was deliberate; the delivery was a bouncer to Paul Collingwood. Former England captain Michael Atherton called for Sreesanth to be banned for the Pietersen beamer, saying that Sreesanth could not control his on-pitch emotions.After leaving out of the Indian team for about a year and half, Sreesanth was called back to play the home Test series against Sri Lanka in November 2009. Sreesanth played the second Test in Kanpur and picked up five wickets in the first innings, which helped India win the match by an innings and 144 runs. Sreesath was awarded the Man of the Match for taking six wickets in the match. After the match, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised him as one of the best bowlers of reverse swing.\n\n\n== World Twenty20 Championship, 2007 ==\nIn September 2007, Sreesanth joined the Indian team in South Africa for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup following his omission for the one-day series in England. Although his performance in the tournament lacked consistency, Sreesanth managed breakthroughs at critical junctures that were vital to his team's success. During the semifinal match against Australia which India won, Sreesanth got the vital wickets of the Australian openers Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. The latter proved to be decisive in turning the match round in India's favour. His spell of 2-12 was named as the third-best T20I bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo voters. In the final against Pakistan, Sreesanth proved expensive with the ball, but became the centre of Indian celebrations as he held on to the catch in the last over that ended Pakistan's innings and made India World Twenty20 champions.\n\n\n== Warwickshire ==\nIn August 2009, Sreesanth signed a deal to play for Warwickshire for the remainder of the English season.\n\n\n== Indian Premier League ==\nSreesanth associated with the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. In the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008, Sreesanth became the second leading wicket taker in the tournament after Sohail Tanveer, claiming 18 wickets. Sreesanth appeared only in the second half of the 2009 edition of the IPL. He could not play the initial matches of the season owing to a stress fracture. He left Kings XI Punjab after the 2010 Indian Premier League and signed for Kochi for the 2011 competition. He signed for Rajasthan royals for the 2012 competition. But he didn't play in 2012 due to injuries. With his spot-fixing controversy coming into light during the 2013 IPL competition, Rajasthan Royals terminated his contract.\n\n\n=== Altercation with Harbhajan Singh ===\nOn 25 April 2008, following the victory of his Kings XI Punjab's victory in the Indian Premier League over the Mumbai Indians at Mohali, Sreesanth was slapped under his eye by Harbhajan Singh, the captain of Mumbai. The incident came to light as Sreesanth was caught by TV cameras sobbing inconsolably on the field before the presentation ceremony. Sreesanth later downplayed the incident saying he had no complaints against Harbhajan who was \"like an elder brother\" to him. Harbhajan's team had lost their third consecutive match when he apparently reacted violently to Sreesanth's approaching him and saying \"hard luck\". The IPL banned Harbhajan from the remainder of the tournament and prohibited him from collecting his salary after finding him guilty. The BCCI launched a separate investigation into the incident and decided to ban Harbhajan for five ODIs, deeming him to have broken the code of conduct in his national contract.\nIn Australia earlier that year, Sreesanth stated that he would maintain an aggressive attitude on the cricket field, \"Sreesanth's way is to be aggressive. Sreesanth will always remain Sreesanth.\"\n\n\n=== Spot fixing allegation and arrest ===\nOn 16 May 2013, the Delhi police arrested Sreesanth and two of his Rajasthan Royals teammates, Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan from Mumbai, on charges of spot-fixing during IPL 6. Jiju Janardhan, another key figure accused of spot-fixing, is reported to be Sreesanth's cousin and an under-22 Gujarat player. On 17 May 2013, Sreesanth confessed to spot-fixing, according to police. However, Sreesanth has always maintained that he is innocent and that he was forced to sign confession statements.\nPolice reported that Sreesanth was drunk at the time of his arrest and thought he was being arrested for being drunk. When the Delhi police team intercepted him, he was reportedly accompanied with a woman in a SUV outside a five-star hotel in Carter Road Promenade, Mumbai.Sreesanth, and the two other players accused of spot fixing had their Rajasthan Royals contracts suspended while their inquiries were pending. On 13 September 2013, Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan were banned for life by BCCI's disciplinary committee.In July 2015, he was acquitted in the spot-fixing case.On 18 October 2017, Kerala High Court restored the life ban on Sreesanth.In March 2019, the Supreme Court of India \"set aside\" the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI. The apex court of the country asked the BCCI to \"reconsider\" and \"revisit\" the length of any fresh ban. Following which the BCCI reduced his ban to 7 years, which meant that he could play all forms of the game from 13 September 2020.\n\n\n== Comeback after the ban ==\nSince the life ban imposed on him had been reduced to a seven year ban, Sreesanth had already talked about doing \"everything possible to get back on the field\". The ban officially ended on 13 September 2020. Sreesanth was selected in the Kerala Team for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2021.\n\n\n== Official warnings ==\nSreesanth is noted for his exuberant and emotional behaviour, especially whilst appealing for and celebrating wickets. He has been warned several times for indiscipline both on and off the cricket field, and frequently fined for violating the player conduct guidelines of the International Cricket Council. In October 2009, the BCCI issued a final warning to Sreesanth that any repetition of his code of conduct violations might result in drastic actions such as a ban from domestic cricket. Subsequently, the Kerala Cricket Association also issued a final warning over repeated violations of their code of conduct after Sreesanth failed to turn up at the Kerala Ranji Trophy team camp in Kannur.In November 2009, however, after more than 18 months of omission from the national team, Sreesanth was recalled to the Test squad for the first two matches against Sri Lanka. He replaced Ishant Sharma for the second Test in Kanpur, where his five wicket haul in the first innings of the match earned him the Man of the Match award and helped India to win the Test match by an innings and 144 runs.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\n\n=== Correct name ===\nIn the English-language media, Sreesanth's full name has been the source of some confusion. He has been variously referred to as \"Sree Sreesanth\", \"Sri Sreesanth\", \"Shantha Sreesanth\". and \"Shanthakumaran Sreesanth\". He has also stated in the past that he wished to be known as \"Sree Santh\".\nIn September 2007, Sreesanth said that his name was just \"Sreesanth\" and that the other variations were incorrect:\n\n\"It's Sreesanth. There is no Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, there is no S. Sreesanth. There was this function recently where they called me Sree Sreesanth, then Sree, and finally S Sreesanth. It's just Sreesanth.\"\n\n\n=== Decision and cancellation of name change ===\nWhen his form slumped in 2006, Sreesanth had tried to change his luck by changing his name to Sreesunth, on numerological advice. He later stated that he was not going to change the name due to sentimental reasons. The word 'santh' in his name is derived from his father's name Santhakumaran Nair.\n\n\n== Film career ==\n\n\n== Television career ==\nIn 2008, he participated in the reality show Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena along with Surveen Chawla.In 2014, Sreesanth participated in the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa in its seventh season. He survived for 5 weeks until he got eliminated.In 2018, Sreesanth participated as a celebrity contestant in the twelfth season of Bigg Boss, the Indian version of the reality TV show Big Brother, where he finished as the runner up of the show. His stay in the house was highly controversial and he ended up as the most controversial contestant of the season and one of the most controversial contestants of the show in general. While he formed close friendships with fellow housemates including season winner Dipika Kakar and Shivashish Mishra, he frequently engaged in ugly fights with most of the other housemates and even guests including Season 11 contestant Vikas Gupta and threatened to leave the house 299 times. His performance in tasks was questioned as well. However, none of these diminished his popularity and he was praised by a large number of supporters, celebrities, former contestants and even fellow housemates for his innocent nature and straightforward attitude. Sreesanth also relived many events of his cricket career in the show, including the slapgate and spot-fixing incidents.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nOn 25 March 2016, Sreesanth joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He contested and lost the Kerala Assembly elections from Thiruvananthapuram. He secured a total of 34,764 votes but lost the election to VS\u2009Sivakumar of the Congress by 11,710 votes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricInfo Player Profile : Sreesanth\nCricket Archive Player Profile : Sreesanth\nS.

He played for Italy for the first time at the 1998 European Championships, making his debut, and a half century, as an opening batsman for his country against Gibraltar, as well as taking three wickets. He later played in the 2002 European Championships, and in 2004, helped Italy to promotion from Division Two into Division One, despite their slip back down the ladder two years later.\nA determined batsman, he quickly made his way up from tailender to opener for Panadura, and, for Italy, commonly starts in the upper-middle order.\n\n\n== External links ==\nHemantha Jayasena at Cricket Archive (subscription required)"

        "article": "Alviro Nathan Petersen (born 25 November 1980) is a former South African international cricketer who plays his domestic cricket in South Africa for the Highveld Lions and in England for Lancashire. A right-handed batsman, he has represented South Africa in Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 cricket. He was the captain of the Highveld Lions in South African domestic cricket.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nPetersen was born and raised in the township of Gelvandale in Port Elizabeth and attended the same state high school as fellow South African Test batsman Ashwell Prince. His father was a taxi driver. He started playing first class cricket in 2001, representing the Northerns cricket team. \nIn 2011, Petersen signed for Glamorgan County Cricket Club for the 2011 English county season, replacing Jamie Dalrymple as the county's captain. Petersen was Glamorgan's top run scorer in every competition. He scored his first double hundred in first class cricket (210) against Surrey at the Oval and was named Glamorgan's player of the year. He returned to South Africa at the end of the county season to play for the Highveld Lions. \nOn 13 February 2012, Essex confirmed Petersen will join the club for the first half of the county season. Petersen could not rejoin Glamorgan as a Kolpak player as he won his place back in the South Africa Test team at the start of 2012. Petersen commented that he wished to stay at Glamorgan: \n\"My agent gave Glamorgan a proposal which they didn't accept... [Glamorgan] can only sign one overseas [player]... We proposed something but [they] rejected... Just to put the record straight, I enjoyed my time with Glamorgan, and yes, would have wanted it to continue\"\nHe left Essex 31 May 2012. In July/August 2012 Petersen opened the batting for South Africa in their three match series in England, scoring 182 in the drawn second test at Headingley.  Petersen was given out twice in this innings but was saved on both occasions by the Decision Review System (DRS).\nPetersen joined Somerset as their overseas player for the first part of the 2013 season. On 31 October 2013, Petersen re-signed for Somerset to be their overseas player for the 2014 season.In 2015, Petersen joined his 4th English county, Lancashire. He scored over a thousand runs in the 2016 County Championship and was successful in white ball cricket too including a hundred vs Leicestershire at Grace Road.  \n\n\n== International career ==\nHe played for South Africa A before breaking into South Africa's ODI squad in 2006, playing in two matches against Zimbabwe.\nHe made his Test debut in February 2010 against India in Kolkata, and he scored a century. He is the third player to score a century on Test debut for South Africa, after Andrew Hudson and Jacques Rudolph. Later in 2010, Petersen played for Kings of Khulna in Bangladesh's NCL Twenty20 tournament. He also played in the three Tests of South Africa's tour of the West Indies, the two Tests of the series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, and all three Tests of the drawn home series against India. He failed to score a century in any of the three series, and was dropped for South Africa's two-Test home series against Australia in November 2011.After a string of high scores in domestic arena in 2011, he was recalled to South Africa's side for the third Test of the home series against Sri Lanka, replacing the dropped Ashwell Prince. Opening the batting in the first innings, he scored his second Test century (109).On 6 January 2015, following South Africa's victory in the third Test against the West Indies, Petersen announced his retirement from international cricket and that he would take up a Kolpak deal in English county cricket. Petersen subsequently signed a two-year contract with Lancashire, on 22 January 2015.In December 2016, Petersen was banned from cricket for two years by Cricket South Africa after his involvement in match-fixing in the 2015\u201316 domestic T20 competition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlviro Petersen at ESPNcricinfo\nAlviro Petersen's profile page on Wisden\nAlviro Petersen at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who until September 2010 played for Essex. In January 2012, he became the first English cricketer to be convicted of spot-fixing, after admitting accepting \u00a36,000 in exchange for bowling an over that was supposed to concede 12 runs.\n\n\n== Essex career ==\nWestfield played for the first time for Essex in the 2005 County Championship against Durham. He made one appearance in the Second XI Championship before the end of the season, and in 2006, played three matches as Essex finished third in Division Two of the 2006 County Championship.\nIn May 2010 he was arrested by Essex police in connection with \"match irregularities\" in the 2009 domestic season, along with team-mate Danish Kaneria. The investigations were believed to focus on a NatWest Pro40 match in September 2009 against Durham, which Essex won.From 2006 onward, Westfield was an occasional player in the Essex side. During the 2010 County Championship, Westfield was released by Essex after struggling to find a regular place in the first team.  Westfield has played as an upper-middle order batsman and as a tail-ender. He held a first-class bowling average of 37.81 by the time of his release by Essex.\n\n\n== Spot-fixing charges ==\nFollowing his arrest on suspicion of a spot-fixing irregularity, it was announced on 15 September 2010 by the Crown Prosecution Service, that Westfield was to be formally charged with conspiracy to defraud over claims he deliberately bowled wides as part of a spot-fixing scam.  Antony Swift, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Westfield would appear at City of London Magistrates' on 23 September 2010.  His Essex teammate Danish Kaneria was released without charge following the investigation. Westfield was convicted on 12 January 2012 and was given a four-month prison sentence. On 22 June 2012, Kaneria was banned for life from playing cricket in England and Wales by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), for his involvement in the scandal.In February 2016, Westfield was given special dispensation by the ECB to allow him to play in 2nd XI matches and minor counties cricket. He later played three MCCA Knockout Trophy matches for Suffolk during the early part of the 2016 season.In October 2018, Kaneria admitted to his involvement in 2009 spot-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMervyn Westfield at CricketArchive\nMervyn Westfield at Cricinfo"

        "article": "Leonard \"Jock\" Livingston (3 May 1920 \u2013 16 January 1998) was an Australian cricketer who played most of his first-class cricket in England.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nLivingston was a hard-hitting left-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper. He played five times for New South Wales with some success, but was not picked for the all-conquering 1948 Australian tour to England, and turned instead to Central Lancashire Cricket League cricket, where he played for Royton Cricket Club, marrying a local girl while there.\nIn 1949\u201350, when Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) declined to tour India, the former England wicketkeeper George Duckworth assembled a Commonwealth side consisting of Lancashire League players plus a handful of English and West Indian cricketers. Livingston captained the side, which included Bill Alley, George Tribe and Frank Worrell. The tour was a big success and the side played five unofficial \"Tests\" against full Indian Test sides.\nAt the end of the tour, Livingston was signed as a batsman by Northamptonshire as part of the county's policy to import talented cricketers, a policy that brought in the England captain Freddie Brown from Surrey. Livingston was an immediate success, scoring 1966 runs in his first season, and over the next eight years he was often near the top of the English batting averages. In the three seasons from 1954, he scored more than 2000 runs per season, with a best performance of 2269 runs in 1954 at an average of more than 55 runs per innings. He had a less successful season in 1957 when the county side finished second in the County Championship, its highest ever placing, and he retired at the end of that season, reappearing in just a couple of later less serious matches, the last in 1964.\nLivingston's value was not just in the runs that he scored, but also the style in which he scored them: in a period when defensive batting was commonplace, he hit the ball hard and often, and was no respecter of reputations. His presence at Northamptonshire also attracted other talented players, including fellow Australians Tribe and Jack Manning and the wicketkeeper Keith Andrew.\n\n\n== Rugby league ==\nLivingston was also a talented rugby league player and spent three seasons playing with South Sydney in the NSWRL from 1941 to 1943.\n\n\n== Personal and later life ==\nIn retirement, he worked for the bat-making company Gray-Nicolls. He was Jewish.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWisden 1951 to 1958 editions\nCricketArchive: Jock Livingston\nRugby League project: Les 'Jock' Livingston"

He owns a psychotic dog called Saxon. He views cricket as a means to making easy money through match-fixing, benefit nights, appearances at supermarket openings and the aborted attempt to open the Dave Podmore Academy of Cricket Excellence.\nBefore the 2006/7 Ashes series he was appointed sledging coach to the Australian cricket team.\nHis Test batting average is 4.\n\"An edge through the slips against Sri Lanka, they cannot take that away from me ...except in Wisden which says it was leg byes\".\nDave Podmore also became a comic radio series broadcast on BBC Radio 4, and often repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra. Between 2001 and 2007 there were three series of Dave Podmore's Cricket Night. An Ashes special, Dave Podmore's Ashes Quest, was broadcast at the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007. \"A History of the Ashes in 100 objects\" (inspired  by the acclaimed BBC Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects) was broadcast to coincide with the Ashes series in December 2010.  To celebrate the start of the 2013 Ashes series, \"Dave Podmore's Ashes Shame\" was broadcast on 7 June 2013. \nReviewing the past week's radio for The Daily Telegraph in July 2015, Gillian Reynolds wrote, \"Dave Podmore\u2019s Toughest Test (Radio 4, Sunday) brought back the great Pod, fictional archetype of the semi-celebrity sportsman presenter, hilarious yet appalling creation of Christopher Douglas, Andrew Nickolds and Nick Newman\", praising the episode's, \"Sublime parodies (of The One Show, the 1950s Home Service, Path\u00e9 news, languid chaps at the Garrick, James Corden\u2019s raucous Sky TV sports quiz A League of Their Own, a comradely Hugh Grant and a snappy Radio 5 Live headline)\".In December 2016, Radio Times chose Dave Podmore Cleans Up for Christmas amongst its selection of the \"best radio for Christmas 2016\".Two books have also been produced, titled Pod Almighty and Word of Pod.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDave Podmore at British Comedy Guide"

He was born in Durban in Natal Province.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nAn all-rounder, Henderson played for a range of teams, both in South Africa and in England. He made his first-class and List A debuts in 1998/99 for Border. He moved to Highveld Lions for the 2006/07 season before playing for Cape Cobras and Boland in 2007/08. He was released by the Cobras at the end of the season and did not play professionally in South Africa afterwards.Henderson played for Heriots Cricket Club in Scotland in 2000 and first played county cricket in England in 2002 for Minor County Berkshire. He played for Kent in 2006 before joining Middlesex in June 2007, initially as a short-term replacement for Chaminda Vaas. For the 2008 season he was re-signed by the county under the Kolpak ruling which meant he was unable to play for South Africa. In the 2008 Twenty20 Cup he scored 281 runs at an average of 40.14 and took 21 wickets. At the 2008 T20 Finals Henderson became the sixth player to have hit 50 sixes in Twenty20 cricket in a Man of the Match performance against the Durham Dynamos in the semi-final. In the final against Kent he bowled the final over of the match and ran out Justin Kemp to clinch the title for Middlesex. He continued to play Twenty 20 cricket for Middlesex until the end of the 2010 English cricket season. He was awarded his county cap by Middlesex in 2008.He was purchased by Rajasthan Royals for $650,000 in the 2009 Indian Premier League auction, $550,000 more than his base price of $100,000. He played twice during the season for Rajastan and had a \"limited impact\" in the competition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTyron Henderson at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Alfonso Clive Thomas (born 9 February 1977) is a South African former professional cricketer. He is a right arm fast-medium bowler and a big hitting lower-order batsman. Playing in South African domestic cricket for North West, Northerns, the Titans, the Lions, and the Dolphins, Thomas has also played English county cricket for Warwickshire and Somerset, Indian Premier League matches for the Pune Warriors, and in Australian domestic cricket for the Adelaide Strikers and the Perth Scorchers. In June 2014, Thomas took four wickets in four balls in a County Championship game against Sussex. He was a pioneer of death bowling in the early years of T20 cricket.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== South African domestic career ===\nThomas made his first-class debut playing for Western Province B in Newlands, Cape Town in the 1998/99 season. In three first-class matches for Western Province B, he took two wickets, and did not play another first-class match until the 2000/01 season after a move to North West. His North West and SuperSport Series debut came against Gauteng, where he finished with match figures of 6/120. Thomas scored his maiden century only two games later, hitting 106 not out while batting at number ten, setting a record tenth wicket partnership for North West of 174 with Garth Roe as he did so. Four months later, Thomas was involved in another record breaking partnership for North West. With the team at 87/7 against Western Province, Thomas joined Morne Strydom at the crease.  492 balls later when Strydom was caught by Neil Johnson, the pair had added 204 to the score; Thomas eventually going on to score 95 not out. The following match, Thomas achieved his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket, as he took the wickets of Easterns top five batsmen during a ten wicket victory; finishing the innings with 6/26.Thomas started the 2001/02 season on top form, claiming five-wickets in an innings on three occasions in the first five games, against Boland, Western Province, and Griqualand West. He represented South Africa in the Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes in November 2001, having a stand-out performance in a Pool One match against Hong Kong as he took 2/4 in his over. He finished the 2001/02 season as North West's leading wicket-taker, with 35 wickets at an average of 22.14. His form saw him picked for South African Board President's XI and South Africa A to play the touring India A side. In a shortened 2002/03 South African domestic season due to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2003, Thomas only appeared in three first-class and five one-day matches for North West, although he did once more represent South Africa in the Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes. He made his second career century against Northerns, making 119*.He moved to Northerns for the start of the 2003/04 season and had immediate success with 36 wickets in his eight SuperSport Series matches. His debut for the club, in which he took three wickets and three catches during Western Province's first innings to help restrict them to 173, was overshadowed by future Somerset teammate Charl Willoughby, who took 7/56 & 4/56 to earn himself man of the match. In the Standard Bank Cup, Thomas' 17 wickets helped the club finish third in the league, which saw them qualify for the semi-finals. The 2003/04 season also saw the introduction of Twenty20 cricket in South Africa in the form of the Standard Bank Pro20 Series.  Thomas represented Titans, a re-branded team merging Northerns and Easterns.  He finished the Pro20 season with five wickets from six matches, including three vital dismissals in the group match against Eagles, when he claimed the wickets of Eagles' top three batsmen in his first two overs, helping to lead his team to a 90 run victory.Since then he has constantly represented South Africa A and was part of the Test tour to India, standing in for an injured Andr\u00e9 Nel.\nHe has represented South Africa in a Twenty20 International, taking 3/25\n\n\n=== English county career ===\nIn August 2007, Thomas signed as Warwickshire's fourth overseas player of the season, playing nine matches for them through August and September. The following summer, he signed for Somerset under the Kolpak ruling. At the end of the 2015 season, it was announced that Thomas' contract with Somerset would not be renewed.\n\n\n==== 2009 Champions League Twenty20 ====\nIn their first match of the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, Thomas played a good lower-middle order innings to guide Somerset to a victory over Deccan Chargers. When Thomas came in, Somerset required 55 runs off the remaining 37 balls of the match.  A record eighth wicket partnership for the club meant that when James Hildreth lost his wicket from the first ball of the final over, Somerset needed five runs off as many balls.  The following ball resulted in no score, and then the wicket of number ten Max Waller.  This wicket allowed Thomas on strike, and he struck a boundary off the fourth ball of the over, and then after a near run out involving number eleven Charl Willoughby, Thomas hit another four from the final ball to grant Somerset the win.\n\n\n=== Australian domestic cricket ===\nThomas was signed to the Adelaide Strikers for the inaugural 2011\u201312 season of the Big Bash League, as one of the franchise's two international players. He played in all of Adelaide's seven matches in the tournament (one of three players to do so), taking five wickets at an average of 35.40. His best bowling figures during the tournament, 3/24, were taken in a loss to the Sydney Sixers at the Adelaide Oval. Thomas did not re-sign with Adelaide for the 2012\u201313 season, instead signing with the Perth Scorchers as a replacement for Albie Morkel, who had not received a clearance from Cricket South Africa. In eight matches during the tournament, he took twelve wickets at an average of 14.91, leading Perth's wicket-taking and finishing fourth in the competition's wicket-taking, behind Ben Laughlin (14 wickets), Lasith Malinga, and Ben Cutting (both 13 wickets). Thomas' best figures, 4/8, were taken in the game against the Melbourne Renegades at the WACA Ground, which are also his best in all Twenty20 matches.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\nIn February 2018, Thomas was appointed bowling coach for the West Indies.In February 2019, Thomas was appointed bowling coach for Hampshire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlfonso Thomas at ESPNcricinfo"

Bodi has represented various teams in South African domestic cricket, Transvaal, Easterns, KwaZulu-Natal and The Titans. In June 2007 he played for an African XI in a Twenty20 game against an Asia XI and made his ODI debut in a game against Zimbabwe later in that years.\nHe was one of the beneficiaries of the selection policy criticized by Kevin Pietersen, forcing him from KwaZulu-Natal. However, Bodi's selection was understandable, given that in the 1999-2000 Supersport series, from four matches Pietersen only averaged 10.75 with the bat, and took 10 wickets at an expensive 37.50, which were not enough to cement his place in the KwaZulu Natal side. In the 2000-2001 season, Bodi replaced Pietersen and came second in the KwaZulu Natal batting averages with 332 runs at an average of 33.20, and was leading wicket-taker for his side that season with 27 wickets at an average of 25.81.\n\n\n== Corruption ==\nIn January 2016 he was charged by Cricket South Africa (CSA) under their anti-corruption code for match fixing in the 2015\u201316 Ram Slam T20 Challenge. On 14 January 2016 CSA confirmed that it was Bodi that was at the centre of a possible match fixing scandal, and on 25 January 2016 it was announced that he had been banned from cricket for 20 years. In November 2018, Bodi pleaded guilty to a total of eight charges of corruption, and could face up to fifteen years in prison. In October 2019, he was sentenced to five years in jail on charges of corruption.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGulam Bodi at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Richard Ernst Levi (born 14 January 1988) is an English-South African cricketer. He played in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. He currently plays for Western Province, Cape Cobras and Northamptonshire. He attended Wynberg Boys' High school in Cape Town and received honours for cricket in 2005.Levi holds a British passport.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nDuring 2012, Levi played 13 international Twenty20 matches for South Africa. He had the highest score of 117*, in his second match, against New Zealand at Seddon Park in Hamilton. He held the record for the most runs scored in a Twenty20 international innings tied with Chris Gayle. This was surpassed by Brendon McCullum on 21 September 2012 when he scored 123 against Bangladesh at Palakelle, Sri Lanka.He was also the only batsman to score a T20I century at Seddon Park.\nLevi has since struggled in International cricket, partly due to being a predominantly leg-side batsman and weak against spin bowling and dropped from the South Africa squad.\n\n\n== Overseas cricket ==\nAlso during 2012, he played for Mumbai Indians in the IPL. He was reportedly signed for $400,000.Later the same year, he played for Somerset, in the Friends Life Twenty20 competition, reaching the semifinal. For 2013, he signed for Northants for Twenty20 matches, and had great success. In 13 matches, he scored 360 runs, including a century and two fifties. Once again he reached the finals day, and scored 57 off just 35 balls in the semifinal victory over Essex, and also played in the victory over Surrey in the final. The following season, he returned to Northants, with the intention of playing in both twenty and fifty over matches, but following a number of injuries to the Northants squad he also played four first-class matches. \nFor 2015 and 2016, he played all forms of cricket for Northants. He returned to Twenty20 finals day in both of these seasons. In 2015 he scored 63 off 46 balls against Warwickshire in the semifinal, but finished on the losing side in the final. In 2016, he was once more on the winning team, beating Durham in the final.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRichard Levi at ESPNcricinfo\nRichard Levi's profile page on Wisden\nRichard Levi at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

        "article": "Colin Alexander Ingram (born  3 July 1985) is a South African cricketer who currently plays for Glamorgan. He represented South Africa in One Day (ODI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) between 2010 and 2013, scoring a century on his ODI debut against Zimbabwe.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nIngram was born in Port Elizabeth. He attended Woodridge College in the Eastern Cape where he was their star cricketer in his years there. He played for the college for five years, captaining the side for three of them. He made his school First XI debut at the age of 14 and continued to play at this level throughout the rest of his high school career. He played provincial cricket for the Eastern Province team and was also selected for the South African schools team.Ingram accepted a scholarship to study at the University of the Free State in 2004. He enjoyed a successful stint in the university team before leaving to return to the Eastern Cape.\n\n\n== First class, domestic & club cricket ==\nIngram struggled for a batting spot in the Eastern Province originally, but soon after he gained experience from both County Cricket, and some playing time for Eastern Province, his skills increased with each innings played.\nIngram is among the brightest talent produced by the Eastern Cape in recent years. In a region of South Africa that has often seen its budding stars bloom fully elsewhere, Ingram has remained true to his roots and stayed with the Warriors. He brings a bracing brand of aggression to opening the batting, and he took his game to the next level when he scored 85 off 111 balls to guide South Africa A to victory over Pakistan A in Colombo in the first match of a triangular series that also involved Sri Lanka A.It was announced on 21 November 2014 that Ingram had signed a three-year contract with Glamorgan as a Kolpak player subject to clearance from Cricket South Africa, the ECB and him obtaining a visa. He had a very successful one day season with Glamorgan in 2015 scoring 405 runs in 8 matches at an average of 81 including three centuries and one 50. His Championship season was steady rather than spectacular as he scored 931 runs at 37.24 with two centuries and four 50s.\n\n\n=== Warriors ===\nIngram played for the Chevrolet Warriors in South African domestic cricket and he was previously captain of this team. He participated in the 2010 Champions League Twenty20, scoring well and assisting his team to reach the final. During the 2015 One Day Cup he almost took Warriors to the final in Cape Town against Cape Cobras, but they were beaten on the net run-rate by the Titans. He scored 93, 106 not out and 90 not out consecutively. The 90 was made in a thrilling South African domestic one day record-breaking run chase against Lions in a match that was played in Buffalo Park, East London.\n\n\n=== Twenty20 Leagues ===\nAs well as playing for Warriors and Glamorgan, Ingram has had some success in Twenty20 leagues, having appeared in the IPL, Big Bash League, Pakistan Super League, Caribbean Premier League and Afghanistan Premier League. He is the first captain to win the Bat Toss conducted by Mathew Hayden for Adelaide Strikers against Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League.\nIn September 2018, he was named in Kabul's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. In December 2018, he was bought by the Delhi Capitals in the player auction for the 2019 Indian Premier League. On 24 February 2019, he became the first player of the team Karachi Kings to score a century, as well as the highest individual scorer in Pakistan Super League at that time.In July 2019, he was selected to play for the Belfast Titans in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. He was released by the Delhi Capitals ahead of the 2020 IPL auction. Ahead of the 2020 PSL Draft, he was released by Karachi Kings, he played for two years with the franchise. In December 2019, he was drafted by Islamabad United as second pick of the Platinum Category round at the 2020   PSL draft. In July 2020, he was named in the St Lucia Zouks squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. However, Ingram was one of five South African cricketers to miss the tournament, after failing to confirm travel arrangements in due time.In October 2020, he was drafted by the Galle Gladiators for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIngram made his Twenty20 International debut against Zimbabwe during Zimbabwe's tour of South Africa in 2010, playing in both matches. He didn't  bat for long, scoring a total of 15 runs in the two-match series (3 & 12) as South Africa registered victories in both matches. He made his mark on his ODI debut in the ODI series against Zimbabwe  that followed by scoring a century (124), only the sixth person to score a century on debut and the first South African ever to achieve this honour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nColin Ingram on Twitter \nColin Ingram at ESPNcricinfo"

He was later selected for the ODI leg as well.In April 2011, Tsotsobe signed to play as an overseas player for Essex County Cricket Club in English county cricket. His form dipped and after taking five wickets from three first-class matches in the second division of the County Championship was dropped from the team. In five one-day matches Tsotsobe managed eight wickets. He expressed his frustration at the situation, remarking that the time he spent with Essex was \"the worst two months [of his] life\".In April 2016, he was charged by Cricket South Africa (CSA) with corruption in relation to matches in the 2015\u201316 Ram Slam T20 Challenge. He was suspended from all cricket as a result. In July 2017, following the completion of the corruption investigation, he was banned for eight years.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nTsotsobe made his international debut for South Africa in a Twenty20 International against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 11 January 2009.\nOn 30 January, he took 4/50 from nine overs in his ODI debut against Australia. South Africa went on to win the match by 39 runs, and the ODI series by 4\u20131.\nHe made his Test debut in the first match against the West Indies in Trinidad in June 2010.He then participated in the second Twenty20 International vs Zimbabwe in place of the injured Morn\u00e9 Morkel and after conceding two fours in his opening over he took the crucial wicket of Hamilton Masakadza. He was a member of the South African squad for the 2011 World Cup, in which South Africa reached the quarter-finals. Tsotsobe is said to have the ability to produce low economy rates and bowl deliveries between 120\u2013135 km/h.\nSouth Africa has decided not to include Tsotsobe into the test team to Australia in 2012\u201313 as they choose pace bowler Rory Kleinveldt instead.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLonwabo Tsotsobe at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Louis Bookman (also known as Buckhalter or Buchalter; 6 November 1890 \u2013 10 June 1943) was an Irish sportsman of Lithuanian Jewish origin who represented Ireland in both football and cricket. Born the son of a rabbi in Lithuania, he arrived in Ireland in 1895 when his family emigrated to escape antisemitism; his family subsequently adopted the name Bookman.Bookman represented numerous football clubs, moving from Belfast Celtic to English club Bradford City in 1911. Three years later he switched to West Bromwich Albion, before the First World War led him to return to Ireland to play for Glentoran and then Shelbourne. He won the County Antrim Shield with Glentoran and helped Shelbourne to a Leinster Cup and league win in 1918\u201319. He returned to the Football League of England to sign for Luton Town in 1919, and played over 100 games for the club before joining Port Vale in September 1923. He returned to Shelbourne the following year. He also won four caps for Ireland, and helped the Irish to claim victory in the 1914 edition of the British Home Championship.\nIn his cricket career, he represented the Railway Union Cricket Club, the Leinster Cricket Club, Bedfordshire, and Ireland. A left-handed batsman and left-arm spin bowler, he played in nine first-class international matches. After his career in sports was over, he worked in Ireland on the railways, and also entered the jewellery business.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nLouis Bookman came on the public scene as a teenager, playing football for the Dublin Jewish team, Adelaide, (named after the large Adelaide Road synagogue). Adelaide, captained by William Woolfson (later founder and long time CEO of a prominent Irish industrial firm), were the winners of the All Ireland Under-18 Football Cup in 1908. It was from this beginning that Bookman went on to a career in professional football.\n\n\n=== Club career ===\nBookman began his senior football career in the Irish League with Belfast Celtic, before joining English side Bradford City in 1911. He failed to establish himself as a first team regular for the \"Bantams\", making just 32 First League appearances in three seasons. During his time at Valley Parade, Bradford were a consistent mid-table team, finishing 11th in 1911\u201312, 13th in 1912\u201313, and ninth in 1913\u201314. Bookman joined league rivals West Bromwich Albion for the 1914\u201315 season, but found that his football career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. During the war he departed The Hawthorns and returned to Ireland to play for Glentoran and Shelbourne. The \"Glens\" finished second in the Belfast & District League in 1915\u201316, and were beaten by Linfield in the Irish Cup final; they did though lift the County Antrim Shield after a 1\u20130 victory over Lisburn Distillery. He then switched The Oval for Shelbourne Park, and helped the \"Shels\" to win both the Leinster Senior Cup and Leinster Senior League in 1918\u201319.\nAfter the war Bookman was bought by Luton Town for \u00a3875, where despite being over thirty, he enjoyed the most successful spell of his football career. The \"Hatters\" could only post a 20th-place finish in the Southern League in 1919\u201320, but were nevertheless elected into the Football League. Luton then finished ninth in the Third Division in 1920\u201321, before reaching fourth and then fifth in the Third Division South in 1921\u201322 and 1922\u201323. He left Kenilworth Road in September 1923, when he was signed by Second Division side Port Vale for a \u00a3250 fee. He lost his first team place in December that year, and was released at the end of the 1923\u201324 season. Bookman then returned to Ireland and re-signed for Shelbourne.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nIn 1911, while playing for Belfast Celtic, Bookman gained an Irish amateur cap. In 1914, together with Val Harris, Patrick O'Connell, Billy Gillespie and Bill Lacey, Bookman was a member of the Ireland team that won the British Home Championship. He won the first of four caps for Ireland in a 2\u20131 win against Wales on 1 January. He then had to wait a further seven years for more international action, as he won a further three caps in 1921: a 2\u20130 defeat to Scotland on 26 February, a 2\u20131 defeat to Wales on 9 April, and a 1\u20131 draw with England on 22 October.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nBookman played cricket for the Railway Union Cricket Club, the Leinster Cricket Club and Bedfordshire. A left-handed batsman and left-arm spin bowler, Bookman made his debut for Ireland in a first-class match against Scotland in July 1920, and went on to play for Ireland on fourteen occasions. He played in eight more first-class matches, including a match against the West Indies. His last match was against Sir Julien Cahn's XI in July 1930.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club statistics ===\nSource:\n\n\n=== International statistics ===\n\n\n== Honours ==\nBelfast CelticCharity Cup runner-up: 1911GlentoranIrish Cup runner-up: 1916\nCounty Antrim Shield winner: 1916ShelbourneLeinster Senior Cup winner: 1919\nLeinster Senior League champion: 1918\u201319IrelandBritish Home Championship winner: 1914\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish football (association; soccer) players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at CricketEurope Stats Zone\nProfile at Cricket Archive\nProfile at Cricinfo"

        "article": "Grant David Elliott (born 21 March 1979) is a former New Zealand cricketer, who played all formats of the game. Primarily a batting all-rounder, Elliott contributed a man of the match performance to provide entrance to New Zealand's first ever World Cup final, by beating South Africa in 2015. Domestically, he played for the Wellington Firebirds.\nIn March 2017, he announced his retirement from international cricket and in August 2018, he retired from all forms of cricket.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThe son of a South African plastic surgeon, Grant Elliott attended St Stithians College, whose notable cricketing alumni include Michael Lumb, Roy Pienaar, David Terbrugge, Dave Rundle and Kagiso Rabada.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nHe debuted with 67 in 1996\u201397 at Gauteng, where on the advice of his captain, former New Zealand test skipper Ken Rutherford, who saw  the quota system possibly blocking his path to higher honours, Elliott left his native Johannesburg for New Zealand in 2001. He played one match for South Africa 'A' against India 'A' before he qualified to play for New Zealand in 2007.\n\n\n== International career ==\nCalled up to the national team in early 2008 during England's tour, he made his Test debut against England in the third test in Napier replacing  Jacob Oram.Elliott has gone on to also make his ODI debut for New Zealand against England taking 3 wickets. In his second game he scored his maiden ODI 50. His maiden ODI century was in the 3rd game of the Chappell-Hadlee series scoring 115 against Australia at the SCG on Sunday 8 February 2009.\nHe also did well in the Champions trophy in South Africa in 2009 as he took a four wicket haul against England at the Wanderers which actually helped New Zealand to qualify for the semifinals and in the semifinals he played an innings  of 75 not out to take the Black caps to victory against Pakistan.\n\n\n=== World records ===\nElliott scored his second ODI century when Sri Lanka toured New Zealand prior to the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Elliott and Luke Ronchi both broke several batting records as the pair lifted New Zealand from 93/5 to a commanding 360 off their 50 overs. Their stand of 267* is the highest 6th wicket partnership in ODIs.In the inaugural Pakistan Super League in 2016 he along with Zulfiqar Babar set the highest 10th wicket partnership in any forms of T20 (63).\n\n\n=== 2015 World Cup ===\nHis finest moment however came  in the 2015 World Cup Semi final against South Africa where he scored an unbeaten 84 and was adjudged the Man of the Match.\nHe hit the winning six off the second to last ball of the innings from Dale Steyn and created history by putting New Zealand into their first ever Cricket World Cup Final. In the final against Australia, Elliot top-scored for New Zealand, scoring 83 runs.After the World Cup, Elliott was named in the Twenty20 side in 2016 after suffering an arm injury playing domestically for Wellington.\nIn April 2016, Elliott announced his retirement from ODI cricket.In August 2017, he was named in a World XI side to play three Twenty20 International matches against Pakistan in the 2017 Independence Cup in Lahore.\n\n\n== Strengths ==\nEarly on, Ken Rutherford noted his strong batting technique while also noting his occasional lack of self-belief. Former coach of the Wellington Firebirds, Anthony Stuart, commented that was \"a tough cookie\", and praised his commitment and high work ethic. Glenn Turner, former convener of the national selection panel, considered Elliott a \"thoughtful character\" whose  offside play was exceptional, such as his hallmark shot, the lofted drive over extra cover.\n\n\n== Other ==\nHe played for Weybridge Cricket Club in the Surrey Championship in 2008.\nElliott is the maker of the Buzz Cricket Bat. It is used by himself, Dewayne Bowden, Mark Houghton, Leighton Morgan, Chris Nevin and Luke Woodcock. Luke Woodcock scored 220 with it in a first-class game. Since he has been injured he has worked with Sky Sport in the 2010 HRV Cup.\nIn 2015 Elliott worked part-time as a business development manager.Now works full-time for cricHQ as a General Manager. He is also a cricket commentator for Spark Sports. His international shirt number has now passed to fellow ex-pat Black Cap - Devon Conway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGrant Elliott on Twitter \nGrant Elliott at ESPNcricinfo\nGrant Elliott at New Zealand Cricket Players Association"

        "article": "George Cecil Ives (1 October 1867 in Germany \u2013 4 June 1950) was an English poet, writer, penal reformer and early homosexual law reform campaigner.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nIves was the illegitimate son of an English army officer and a Spanish-Jewish baroness. He was raised by his paternal grandmother, Emma Ives. They lived between Bentworth in Hampshire and the South of France. \nIves was educated at home and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he started to amass 45 volumes of scrapbooks (between 1892 and 1949). These scrapbooks consist of clippings on topics such as murders, punishments, freaks, theories of crime and punishment, transvestism, psychology of gender, homosexuality, cricket scores, and letters he wrote to newspapers. His interest in cricket led him to play a single first-class cricket match for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1902.Ives met Oscar Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892.  Ives was already working for the end of the oppression of homosexuals, what he called \"the Cause.\" He hoped that Wilde would join \"the Cause\", but was disappointed. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit.By 1897, Ives created and founded the Order of Chaeronea, a secret society for homosexuals which was named after the location of the battle where the Sacred Band of Thebes was finally annihilated in 338 BC. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson.The same year, Ives visited Edward Carpenter at Millthorpe. This marked the beginning of their friendship. \nIn 1914, Ives, together with Edward Carpenter, Magnus Hirschfeld, Laurence Housman and others, founded the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. He also kept in touch with other progressive psychologists such as Havelock Ellis and Professor Cesare Lombroso.\nThe topics addressed by the Society in lectures and publications included: the promotion of the scientific study of sex and a more rational attitude towards sexual conduct; problems and questions connected with sexual psychology (from medical, juridical, and sociological aspects), birth control, abortion, sterilisation, venereal diseases, and all aspects of prostitution. In 1931, the organisation became the British Sexological Society. Ives was the archivist for the Society whose papers are now held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\nIves was a member of the Humanitarian League, a radical advocacy group, which operated between 1891 and 1919.Ives also visited prisons across Europe and specialised in the study of the penal methods, particularly that of England. He lectured and published books on the topic. He died in London but was buried in the village of Bentworth, Hampshire.\n\n\n== The Ives papers ==\nAt his death in 1950, George Ives left a large archive covering his life and work between 1874 and 1949. The papers were bought in 1977 by the Harry Ransom Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.  They have been divided into four sections as follows:\n\n\n=== I. Correspondence, 1874\u20131936 ===\nThis section contains invitations and letters regarding Ives' writings and lectures on prison reform, sodomy, the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, and other topics. Ives' correspondents include Adolf Brand, Oscar Browning, Edward Carpenter, Havelock Ellis, Norman Gale, Augustus Hare, Ernest Jones, Cesare Lombroso, Charlotte Maria North, Reggie Turner and Edward Westermarck.\n\n\n=== II. Works, 1897\u20131937 ===\nThis section groups examples of Ives' published works, lectures, notes and samples of verse, both as typescripts and holographs. The topics represented include: prison reform, crime and punishment, historical views of sexuality, religion.\n\n\n=== III. Diaries, 1886\u20131949 ===\nThe bulk of the material consists of 122 volumes of diaries kept by Ives from the age of nineteen until about six months before his death at age eighty-two. Most of the diaries have daily entries for the period from 20 December 1886 to 16 November 1949. The view Ives provides in his diary of the life of an upper-middle class English homosexual from the end of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century is of particular interest for understanding the homosexual movement in England during this time. The content varies from descriptive impressions of social events to detailed examinations of his friends and acquaintances, analyses of the treatment of criminals, and the workings of prisons. From volume thirteen on, Ives indexed his diaries, and he often used them when he was preparing for a lecture or other writings.\n\n\n=== IV. Miscellaneous, 1888\u20131949 ===\nThis section includes the rules and wax seal impressions for the Order of Chaeronea, along with a library catalogue for the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, and a scrapbook of reviews and loose clippings for three of Ives' books, Eros' Throne (1900), A History of Penal Methods (1914), and Obstacles to Human Progress (1939). There is also a galley proof of George Bernard Shaw's preface to English Prisons Today (1922), prior to alterations.\n\n\n== Raffles ==\nHe was the model for Raffles, the fictional Victorian gentleman thief, according to Andrew Lycett. Lycett says that the creator of Raffles, E. W. Hornung, \"may not have understood this sexual side of Ives' character\", but that Raffles \"enjoys a remarkably intimate relationship with his sidekick Bunny Manders.\"\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Verses ===\nBook of Chains (1897)\nEros' Throne (1900)\n\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\nPenal Methods in the Middle Ages (1910)\nThe Treatment of Crime (1912)\nA History of Penal Methods: Criminals, Witches, Lunatics (1914)\nThe Sexes, Structure, & \"Extra-organic\" Habits of certain Animals (1918)\nThe Continued Extension of the Criminal Law (1922)\nEnglish Prisons Today (Prefaced by G.B.

        "article": "Alexandra Joy Blackwell (born 31 August 1983) is a former professional cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia as a specialist batsman. In October 2017, she made her 250th international appearance for the Australian women's cricket team. In November 2019, she announced her retirement from cricket, after a career that spanned eighteen years. Her identical twin sister Kate has also played for Australia.\nBlackwell made her senior debut for New South Wales in the 2001\u201302 Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). Playing in the middle-order she had little to do as the opposition bowlers struggled to penetrate the New South Wales batting line-up. Blackwell made 33 runs at 33.00 in her debut season as New South Wales won the WNCL. The following season, she batted higher up the order and made 212 runs at 30.28, and was selected for the national team at the end of the season with a WNCL career total of only 245 runs. Making her international debut in 2002\u201303 in a quadrangular One Day International (ODI) tournament, she had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 54 runs at 27.00 but was unexpectedly successful with the ball, taking a total of 4/34 despite only having one previous wicket at senior level. She made her Test debut in a two-match series against England immediately afterwards, hitting a half-century in the latter fixture. Alex Blackwell is the 142nd woman to play Test cricket for Australia.Over the next two years, Blackwell was inconsistent at international level and was in and out of the team due to poor performance. However, she was able to maintain her position for the 2005 World Cup in South Africa, playing in all but one match as Australia won the tournament without a loss. Playing in the middle-order, she was not required to bat often as the opposition rarely broke through the Australian batting, making 67 runs at 33.50. Her 53 against New Zealand was her first half-century in ODIs. However, Blackwell made only 48 from four Test innings during the subsequent tour of England and was unable to cement her place in the Australian team. Blackwell had a prolific 2005\u201306 WNCL season, scoring 411 runs including her maiden century, but was unable to translate her good domestic form into results for Australia, making only 83 runs in four innings against India at the end of the season.\nAfter missing the first half of the 2006\u201307 season due to injury, Blackwell had a stint for Otago in New Zealand's State League, scoring 315 runs at 52.50. However, her international form remained poor and she was dropped midway through an ODI tournament in India after making 54 runs in four innings. She earned a recall midway through the subsequent Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. Blackwell established herself at international level in 2007\u201308. After making 291 runs at 41.57 in the WNCL, she broke through for her maiden ODI century in the home series against England. She made another fifty later in the series, followed by consecutive half-centuries against New Zealand, ending the international season with 389 runs at 43.22.\nAfter playing in the Women's County Championship in England in 2008, Blackwell made 255 runs at 85.00 with a century and two fifties as Australia swept India 5\u20130 at home at the start of the 2008\u201309 season. She continued her strong form in the WNCL, scoring 372 runs at 62.00. Blackwell made consecutive fifties in the two warm-up matches and then scored 190 runs at 38.00 as Australia came fourth in the 2009 World Cup. She had a poor ODI tour of England, making single-figure scores in all five matches, before returning to Australia to score 489 runs at 61.12 in the WNCL, including two centuries, as New South Wales won for the fifth consecutive time, and making 191 runs at 47.75 in the T20 tournament.\nBlackwell led Australia in the Rose Bowl series in early-2010 after regular captain Jodie Fields was sidelined due to injury. They won all eight ODIs but lost all five T20 internationals. Blackwell made 235 runs at 33.57 including two fifties.\nIn February 2018, she announced her retirement from international cricket, but would continue to play in the Women's Big Bash League. In November 2018, she was named in Sydney Thunder's squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBlackwell was born in Wagga Wagga, but raised in Yenda, a small rural town outside of Griffith, New South Wales. She and her identical twin sister Kate attended Barker College on the North Shore of Sydney as boarders.In March 2000, Blackwell was called into the New South Wales team for the Under-17 interstate competition. In the first match, she took 3/7 and was not required to bat in a ten-wicket victory over Victoria Blue. Her top-score for the tournament came in the sixth match against Western Australia, when she scored 57 not out. New South Wales won all of their eight matches to claim the competition and Blackwell ended with 149 runs at 37.25 and seven wickets at 17.00.\n\n\n== Domestic debut ==\n\nDuring the 2001\u201302 season, Blackwell made her senior debut for New South Wales. In her first match against Queensland, she bowled two expensive overs, conceding 18 runs, and was not required to bat as New South Wales won by six wickets. Batting in the middle-order, often lower than the top-six, Blackwell as only required to bat once in her first four matches, making nine not out in the second match against Queensland and being at the crease when the six-wicket win was registered. The season was interrupted by the national Under-19 competition, and Blackwell was prominent with both bat and ball as New South Wales won all of their six matches. Apart from one duck, Blackwell reached 30 in her remaining five innings to aggregate 207 runs at 41.40. She also took 11 wickets at 9.36. In five of the six matches, she scored at least 30 and took two or more wickets. Blackwell returned to senior duty and again had little to do in the lower order as her state's leading batsmen encountered little difficulty with opposition bowlers. New South Wales defeated Victoria in both round-robin matches and beat them again in the finals series 2\u20130 to win their sixth consecutive national title. Blackwell was at the crease, unbeaten on 12, as New South Wales reached their target in the second match with four wickets in hand, having not been required to bat in the seven-wicket win in the first final the day before. Blackwell played in eight matches but was only required to bat four times for a total of 33 runs at 33.00 and bowled seven overs without success.At the end of the season, Blackwell was selected for the Australia Youth team that played New Zealand A. She made 76 runs at 19.00 in four matches with a highest score of 32 and took a total of 1/43 from 11 overs. This was followed by a match against the senior New Zealand team. Blackwell took 1/18 and scored 2 in a 21-run defeat.In 2002\u201303, Blackwell played in her first full season in the WNCL, taking to the field in all 10 of New South Wales' matches. After not being trusted to bat at No. 7 or higher in the first match of the season, which New South Wales won, Blackwell was unbeaten on 17 when they lost to South Australia in the second match of the double-header the next day, having been attacked and conceded 23 runs from two overs in South Australia's innings. Blackwell made her maiden half-century at senior level in the next match, scoring 74 not out to guide her state of a five-wicket win over Victoria. She then made three single-digit scores before rediscovering form in the last two round-robin matches against Western Australia, making 36 and 38. New South Wales won six matches of their eight matches and faced Victoria in the final. Blackwell made only 14 and 17 as New South Wales lost both of the finals, ending their run of six WNCL titles in a row. In the second final, she took her maiden wicket at senior level, but her sporadic bowling was otherwise unsuccessful, conceding 45 runs in 8 overs for the season. Blackwell ended the season with 212 runs at 30.28.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== International debut ===\nAt the end of the season, Blackwell was called into the national team for a quadrangular ODI tournament held in Lincoln in New Zealand. In addition to the hosts and Australia, England and India were also competing. Each team played two matches against the other three teams in the round-robin phase. Blackwell made her debut in Australia's second match, against England, but neither batted nor bowled in a seven-wicket win. In the next match, against India, she scored 27 before being run out and had unexpected success as a bowler, taking 2/8 from six overs in a 59-run win. She was left out of Australia's fourth match, against England, but returned for the last two qualifying matches. She took 2/18 against India before making six not out as the winning runs were scored against the hosts. In the final, she made 21 as Australia scored 214 and defeated the hosts by 109 runs. Blackwell ended her first international series with 54 runs at 27.00 and four wickets at 8.50 at an economy rate of 2.61.  The success with the ball is something she has not repeated. In seven years since, she had only taken two more wickets at international level. Alex Blackwell is the 97th woman to play One Day International cricket for Australia.Australia then hosted England in two Tests. Blackwell made her debut at the Gabba in Brisbane. In a low-scoring match, she bowled 11 overs including six maidens, registering figures of 0/9 as the tourists made 124 batting first. Blackwell then came in at 4/40 and made four from 14 balls in her maiden Test innings before being dismissed by Laura Newton, precipitating a collapse of 6/28 as Australia fell to be all out for 78. After England was all out for 92, Blackwell came to the crease with the score at 4/104, with 35 runs still needed for victory. She and Michelle Goszko batted slowly, adding seven runs in nine overs before the latter was out. Blackwell was then joined by Julie Hayes, who scored 18 of the remaining 28 runs required for victory. Blackwell was nine not out and was at the crease when the winning runs were registered with five wickets in hand, having batted for 85 balls in 85 minutes. Despite her circumspect batting, Blackwell was retained for the Second Test at Bankstown Oval in Sydney. Australia batted first and Blackwell came in at 4/90. Soon after, her partners Mel Jones and Hayes fell in quick succession as Australia lost 3/13 to be 6/103. Blackwell then added 21 with Cathryn Fitzpatrick before the former was out for 13; this triggered a collapse of 4/10 as Australia were all out for 134. Blackwell came in at 4/49 with Australia still four runs behind in the second innings. She added 136 in 226 minutes for the fifth wicket with Lisa Sthalekar before being dismissed for 58, having hit six boundaries from 236 balls. In pursuit of a target of 206, England reached 6/133 when time ran out. Blackwell did not bowl in the match.Blackwell played in all of New South Wales' 11 matches in the 2003\u201304 WNCL, scoring 183 runs at 26.14. In the fourth match of the season against South Australia, she made an unbeaten 70 in a vain attempt to secure victory in the run-chase as her state were bowled out and fell to a ten-run defeat. She was then run out twice for 26 and 23 in the two matches against reigning champions Victoria, as New South Wales tied one match and lost the next by four wickets. It was two of three instances in which Blackwell was run out during the season. New South Wales had a chance for redemption in the finals against Victoria. Blackwell made a duck\u2014her third single-digit score in as many matches\u2014in the first final, which the titleholders won by six wickets. In the next two matches, she was unbeaten on 13 and 16 and at the crease when the winning runs were brought up. New South Wales won the second final by five wickets and scraped home in the deciding match by three wickets to regain the WNCL title. Blackwell's sporadic bowling\u201426 overs in total\u2014yielded one wicket at 118.00 at an economy rate of 4.37.\n\n\n=== Inconsistency at international level ===\nBlackwell retained her position in the national team for the Rose Bowl series, which consisted of three matches each in New Zealand and then Australia. She played in only the third match in New Zealand and did not bat in the seven-wicket win, before being omitted for the first match at home. She was recalled for the second match and made 15 not out in a 40-run win, before her unbeaten 22 guided Australia to a four-wicket win in the final match at Bellerive Oval, as the hosts took out the series 5\u20131.In the first four matches of the 2004\u201305 WNCL, Blackwell made 54 and 27 in her only innings as the opposition bowlers failed to penetrate the New South Wales top-order in the other two matches. The defending champions won all four matches before the season was adjourned when the national team travelled to India in December for seven-match bilateral ODI series. Blackwell scored two in a 14-run win in the opening match in Mysore and was dropped for the next match. She was recalled for the third match in Mumbai, run out for a duck in a six-wicket defeat. The tourists won the next two matches to seal the series, but Blackwell was not prominent. She was not required to bat in the third match and was run out for 13 in the next. She made 19 in the sixth ODI and was dropped for the final match of the tour, ending the series with 34 runs at 8.50.\n\n\n=== 2005 World Cup ===\n\nBlackwell returned to Australia needing a strong end to the WNCL season to ensure selection for the 2005 World Cup in South Africa. In the four remaining round-robin matches, she made 96 runs in four innings, half of these coming in a five-wicket win over Queensland. New South Wales met Victoria in the finals. Blackwell was not required to bat in a seven-wicket win in the first match before making 13 and 24 as the reigning champions were dismissed for 71 and 109, losing the last two matches by five wickets and 50 runs respectively. Blackwell ended the season with 214 runs at 26.75 and this was enough to secure retention in the national team despite her poor results during the Indian tour. The Australians hosted New Zealand for three Rose Bowl ODIs in the western coastal city of Perth before the teams crossed the Indian Ocean to reach South Africa. Blackwell was not productive in the trans-Tasman matches. She made six and took 1/8 in the first match, and was then run out for 27 in the next game. She was omitted for third match.In the first match of the World Cup, Blackwell was persevered with by the selectors; she did not bat as England made 7/169 before rain ended the match. This was followed by an encounter with New Zealand. Blackwell scored 53 in Australia's 7/174, helping to set up a 32-run win. In the third match against the West Indies, she was run out for a duck in a 79-run win, and was dropped for the 97-run win over the hosts. The group stages ended with two easy victories. Blackwell took 1/8 from two overs, her last international wicket, as Australia dismissed Sri Lanka for 57. Since then she has bowled only 47 balls in senior matches. She was not required to bat as Australia reached their target with eight wickets in hand. The match against Ireland was similar as Australia achieved the target of 67 with all wickets intact. The final pool match against India was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to inclement weather, and Australia met England in the semi-finals. Blackwell scored 10 not out, helping to complete the closing stages of a five-wicket win. In the final against India, she came in towards the end of the innings and made four not out as Australia amassed 4/215. Australia bowled India out for 117 to win by 98 runs. Blackwell ended the tournament with 67 runs at 33.50.In the northern hemisphere summer of 2005, Australia toured England. They started with a stopover in Ireland, and only the second of the three ODIs went ahead; the other two matches were washed out by persistent rain. Blackwell made four not out as Australia made 3/295 and took a 240-run win.Australia played two Tests in England. In the First Test at County Ground in Hove, Sussex, Blackwell batted at No. 5 and played alongside identical twin sister Kate, who was making her Test debut. She struggled in both innings, making five and nine and scoring at a strike rate of 20 or less in both innings. After taking an 82-run lead, Australia set the hosts a target of 306. Blackwell took two catches, her first at Test level, removing Claire Taylor and Jenny Gunn as the hosts ended on 7/172 to salvage a draw. In the Second Test at New Road, Worcester, Blackwell made 20 and 14 as Australia ceded a 158-run first innings lead and eventually lost by six wickets after Blackwell's fall in the second innings left them at 5/46, still 112 runs in arrears. She ended the series with 48 runs at 12.00.Blackwell had mediocre results in the five ODIs, scoring 5, 27, 17 not out, 21 not out and 14 as Australia won 3\u20132. She ended the series with 84 runs at 28.00. Blackwell then played in Australia's inaugural Twenty20 international at the County Ground, Taunton, only the second international match in the history of the new format. She was not required to bat as Australia won with seven wickets in hand.Having failed to establish herself at international level in 2005, Blackwell started the 2005\u201306 WNCL season strongly, scoring 61 in the first match of the campaign, a seven-wicket win over Western Australia. The next day she made 130, her maiden WNCL century, setting up a 118-run win against the same team. She then top-scored with 86 in the next match against Queensland, scoring more than half of the runs in a successful run-chase of 3/161. After a run of three scores of 10 or less, Blackwell made 36 and 30 as New South Wales won both matches against Victoria in their last double-header of the season. New South Wales won seven of their eight matches to qualify for the finals against Queensland. In the first match, she scored 50 as New South Wales reached their target of 175 with eight wickets in hand, having earlier taken two catches. She made only three in the next match as New South Wales fell for 154 and lost by three wickets, before scoring 10 as her state made 146 and won by two runs to claim the WNCL. Blackwell ended the season with 411 runs at 38.36.After her strong WNCL season, Blackwell was retained for the series against India in Adelaide at the end of the Australian summer. Opening the batting, she made a 17-ball duck in the one-off Test at the Adelaide Oval, which Australia won by an innings. Blackwell took three catches but made only one in the first ODI. She only made 19 in the next match but was retained for the third and final ODI, top-scoring with an unbeaten 63 in a nine-wicket win. She ended the series with 83 runs at 41.50.Blackwell missed the five-ODI Rose Bowl series at home and the first four WNCL matches of the 2006\u201307 season due to injury. She returned for the final four round-robin matches and made 42, 17, 74 and 4 as New South Wales won all four matches. She was not effective in the three finals against Victoria, making a duck in a one-wicket win in the first match before scoring one as Victoria levelled the series with an eight-wicket triumph the following day. In the deciding match, she made 20 as New South Wales reached their target of 206 with three wickets in hand. Blackwell ended the season with 158 runs at 22.57.During gaps in New South Wales' schedule, Blackwell travelled across to New Zealand for three weekends of domestic one-dayers for Otago. In her debut for the team, she struck an even 100 in a 162-run win over Northern Districts. She added 79 in a 182-run victory the following day. After making 27 and 31 against Auckland, Blackwell ended her stay with 1 and 77 against Canterbury; Otago lost both matches. She ended with 315 runs at 52.50 in her six-match stint.After the end of the Australian season, Blackwell was selected for the ODI team for a four-nations tournament in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in round-robin phase. In the first match, she made 25 in a six-wicket defeat against New Zealand, who took 41 runs without loss from her four overs en route to a six-wicket win. Blackwell then made 11 in a three-wicket loss to the hosts, leaving Australia in danger of missing the final. She was retained but made a duck and 18 as Australia won their next two matches against England and New Zealand. Blackwell was then omitted from the two remaining round-robin matches and the final, which Australia won by six wickets. She ended the tournament with 54 runs at 13.50.Blackwell was retained in the Rose Bowl series held in tropical Darwin in July 2007, the middle of the southern hemisphere winter. After watching the first two matches from the sidelines, she was called into the team for the third match where she made an unbeaten 44 to see Australia to a six-wicket win. She made 4 and 27 in the two remaining matches, ending the series with 75 runs at 37.50 as Australia prevailed 3\u20132.Blackwell started the 2007\u201308 WNCL season strongly, scoring half-centuries in each of the first four matches, all of which were won by New South Wales. She made 75 not out and 52 against South Australia, followed by 60 and 55 against Victoria. The results in each of the two double-headers were identical; New South Wales won the first match by seven wickets before prevailing the next day by 25 runs. Blackwell made 42 in the penultimate round-robin match but otherwise failed to reach double figures in the last four matches. New South Wales qualified in first place for the final against South Australia after winning seven of their eight matches and were awarded the title after the decider was washed out. Blackwell scored 291 runs at 41.57. In her only T20 innings, Blackwell made 37 not out in an eight-wicket win over Western Australia.\n\n\n=== Established international cricketer ===\nThe domestic competition was followed by two international series against England and New Zealand. Blackwell made 10 as Australia won the T20 international against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 21 runs. In the ODIs that followed, drawn 2\u20132, Blackwell established herself at international level. After scoring 11 in an Australian defeat in the first ODI, she struck 101\u2014her maiden ODI century\u2014the next day at the MCG to set up an 84-run win. After making five as England took a 2\u20131 series lead, Blackwell made 61 in the final match to help set up a series-levelling 41-run win. She ended the series with 178 runs at 44.50. In the one-off Test at Bowral, Blackwell opened the innings. She made one as Australia batted first and reached 154 in their first innings before conceding a 90-run first innings lead. In the second innings, she made 24 before being bowled for the second time in the matches by pace bowler Isa Guha as the tourists won by six wickets in hand.The Australians then headed to Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln, New Zealand, for a T20 international and five ODIs. Blackwell made 15 and took two catches as the hosts won the T20 by four wickets. She then made 44 of 5/189 to help secure a 63-run win in the first ODI. In the next two matches, she made seven twice, as the hosts claimed both matches to take the series lead. Australia thus needed to win the remaining two matches. In the fourth match, Blackwell made 61 in an Australian win by six runs. In the final match, she made 91 to help steer Australia to their target of 250 and a series-clinching eight-wicket win. Blackwell ended the series with 211 runs at 42.20. For the whole international season, she scored 389 runs at 43.22 to establish herself at international level.During the 2008 Australian winter, Blackwell travelled to England for a domestic season in the northern hemisphere summer, playing for Berkshire in the county competition, and Rubies in the Super Fours. Blackwell failed to capitalise on her starts for the county, registering scores of 41, 22, 0, 39 and 30 in her five one-day innings for a total of 132 runs at 26.40. It was a similar story in four one-dayers for Rubies, making 58 runs at 14.50 with a best of 26. Blackwell had little impact in the T20s for Rubies, making four and a duck.The 2008\u201309 Australian season started with a tour by India. Blackwell started with 0/14 from her only over and scored 14 in a six-wicket win in the T20 match. She was prominent as the hosts completed a 5\u20130 clean sweep of the ODIs. In the first match at Hurstville Oval, she made 75 in an eight-wicket win. After making eight and one not out in the next two matches, Blackwell made 106 not out, setting up a 118-run win in the fourth match at Manuka Oval. She ended the series with 65 run out in the seven-wicket win in the final match. Blackwell aggregated 255 runs at 85.00 for the series.Blackwell had a slow start to the WNCL, failing to pass 22 in her first three innings; she made an unbeaten 50 in an eight-wicket win over Western Australia, and then struck an unbeaten 101 as New South Wales made 1/176 to defeat South Australia by nine wickets. The next day, she made 75 but it was not enough to prevent a 39-run loss against the same team. In the two final round-robin matches against Victoria, she made 70 not out in a nine-wicket win, her fourth consecutive score above 50. The streak ended with 22 in a three-wicket win the next day, and New South Wales hosted the final the following week against the same team. Blackwell made only three as New South Wales made 4/120 to win by six wickets. She ended the season with 372 runs at 62.00.\n\n\n=== 2009 World Cup and World Twenty20 ===\nAfter the WNCL ended, the Australians headed to New Zealand for the Rose Bowl series. Blackwell made 10 and 9 in the first two matches as Australia went 2\u20130 down. She then made 59 and 37 in the next two matches as Australia levelled the series; the fifth and final match was washed out. The teams returned to Australia for the World Cup. In two warm-up matches against England and Sri Lanka, Blackwell made 91 not out and 56 retired; Australia won the matches by 25 and 230 runs respectively.In the opening match of the World Cup campaign, Blackwell made four as Australia fell short of their target on the Duckworth-Lewis method. Australia then needed to win their two remaining group matches to reach the Super Six phase. Blackwell made 22 and took three catches as Australia defeated South Africa by 61 runs. She then scored 46 not out in a 47-run win over the West Indies. In the first Super Six match, against India, Blackwell scored 54 as Australia made 7/218, falling 17 runs of their target. She then made seven run out in the win over Pakistan by 107 runs. She made 38 not out in Australia's final Super Six match against England, and although the hosts won by eight wickets, it was not enough for them to place in the top two in the standings and qualify for the final. In the third-place playoff against India, Blackwell made 19 in a three-wicket defeat. \nBlackwell ended the tournament with 190 runs at 38.00.Blackwell was selected for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three-match series in tropical Darwin at the beginning of June before the World Cup, and Blackwell played in all the matches, making 11 not out and 10 in her two innings. Australia took the series 2\u20131.After arriving in England, Blackwell made 19 in Australia's 8/123, which New Zealand surpassed with nine wickets in hand. She was not required to bat in an eight-wicket win over the West Indies. Blackwell then 40 not out as Australia defeated South Africa by 24 runs.This put Australia into the semi-final against England. Blackwell made five before England overhauled Australia's score  of 5/163 to reach the final, which they won. She ended the tournament with 64 runs at 32.00.Blackwell and the Australians stayed in England for a bilateral series against the hosts, who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s, after the end of the World Twenty20. In the one-off T20 match, she made 18 as Australia upset England by 34 runs. She played in all five ODIs, and had a torrid time against the English bowling, scoring 7, 3, 0, 0 and 5. She started with a 38-ball 7 in Chelmsford and had a series of slow-scoring single-digit innings, ending the series with a strike rate of 19.73.England won all the ODI matches except the last, which was washed out. Blackwell played in the one-off Test match at County Road in Worcestershire.

After the tourists had taken a 41-run lead, Blackwell made 68 as Australia made 231 to set the hosts a target of 273. Blackwell and opening partner Nitschke put on 49 before the latter was out for 25. Blackwell then added 81 in 21 overs with Rolton before the latter was dismissed, leaving the score at 2/130. She was then out at 3/150 after hitting six fours and a six from 135 balls, sparking a collapse of 8/81. The match was drawn as the hosts ended at 3/106.\n\n\n=== Heavy WNCL scoring and national captaincy ===\n\nAfter making single-figure scores in consecutive matches, Blackwell struck an unbeaten 121, scoring more than half the runs in an eight-wicket win over the Australian Capital Territory in the third match of the season. After making 37 and 39 in the pair of matches against Victoria, she was prominent in the double-header against Western Australia, scoring 138 to set up a 127-run win, before making an unbeaten 61 the next day in a ten-wicket win. In the final, Blackwell top-scored with 54 as New South Wales batted first and made 9/206. They then dismissed the Victorians for 147 to seal a 59-run win. Blackwell ended the WNCL with 489 runs at 61.12.A T20 domestic tournament was introduced, and Blackwell was prolific in the six qualifying matches, scoring 31 not out, 32, 30, 41, 33 not out and 24 not out. New South Wales won all of the round-robin matches except the fixture against Victoria. The two teams met again in the final, and Blackwell failed for the only time in the competition, making a duck as New South Wales fell for 75 in pursuit of 128 for victory.After the series, Blackwell led Australia in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand due to an injury to incumbent captain Jodie Fields. The campaign started with five ODIs in Australia. In the first two matches, held at the Adelaide Oval, she made 51 and 34 as the hosts won by 115 runs and six wickets respectively. The last three matches of the series were held at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. In the third ODI, Blackwell top-scored with 92 as Australia took a 102-run win and sealed the series. She was not required to bat in the ten-wicket win in fourth match and made one as Australia took a 5\u20130 whitewash with a comfortable 103-run win in the final ODI. Blackwell ended her first series as captain with 178 runs at 44.50.The ODIs were followed by three T20s at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand at the start of the second phase of the bilateral contests. Blackwell played in every match and Australia was whitewashed. The three matches in Hobart were closely fought; Blackwell made 11, top-scored with 40, and added 26 as New Zealand won by two, one and seven runs respectively. The hosts won the last two matches in New Zealand convincingly by 59 and 17 runs; Blackwell made 9 and 8 as the Australians were bowled out for 73 and 98. She ended the series with 94 runs at 18.80.Australia then swept New Zealand 3\u20130 in the ODIs in New Zealand. In the first match, Blackwell made five as Australia came closest to defeat in the ODIs, scraping home by two wickets. She made 8 and 44 in last two matches in Invercargill to complete the clean sweep. In all the ODIs she made 235 runs at 33.57. Blackwell had thus led Australia to eight consecutive ODI wins over New Zealand.\n\n\n=== 2010 World Twenty20 triumph ===\nBlackwell led the team at the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and captained in every match after Fields was again forced out by injury. She batted at No. 4 in all but one match. In the first warm-up match against New Zealand, she opened the bowling with her occasional medium pace, and took 1/29 from her four overs, dismissing the opposing captain and opener Aimee Watkins. She then came in at No. 4 and top-scored with 44 from as many balls as Australia lost by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she made 35 not out from 21 balls and featured in a 55-run partnership from 40 balls with Jess Cameron. She did not bowl herself as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs.Australia were grouped with defending champions England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Blackwell ran out Holly Colvin to end the innings with 15 balls unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were 2/10 when Blackwell came to the crease. She made 7 from 14 balls in a partnership of 34 from 33 balls\u2014Australia's largest of the match\u2014with Leah Poulton. However, their dismissals in consecutive overs started a collapse of 5/19 from 34 balls. However, Australia recovered, and Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.A Super Over eventuated, and both teams ended with 2/6 after both suffered run outs in an attempt to secure a seventh run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match\u2014Jess Cameron scored the solitary six.In the next match against South Africa, Blackwell made 9 from 14 balls, the only Australian in the first seven batting positions to score at less than a strike rate of 133.33. A sudden collapse saw Australia lose 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. They eventually completed a 22-run win. In the final group match, Blackwell top-scored with 28 from 26 balls, and batted through most of the innings, although she only faced a small minority of the 74 balls delivered during her time at the crease, as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Shanel Daley from the bowling of Sthalekar as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet.Australia went on to face India in the semi-final. Blackwell ran out opposing captain and all rounder Jhulan Goswami, one of three wickets to fall in the 17th over bowled by Ellyse Perry. Australia were set a target of 120, and Blackwell promoted herself to No. 3 after opener Elyse Villani fell for a duck in the first over. Blackwell and Nitschke counter-attacked, and scored the next 50 runs in 40 balls, before Nitschke was out to end a stand of 74 runs in 60 balls. Blackwell reached her fifty in 37 balls and was eventually out for 61 from 49 balls with 17 runs still required from 28 balls for victory. The Australians reached their target with seven wickets and seven balls to spare, and Blackwell was named the player of the match.In the final against New Zealand, Blackwell elected to bat, but New Zealand started more effectively. Nitschke and Villani were out in consecutive overs and Blackwell came in at 2/14 in the fourth over. After being unable to score from her first six balls, Blackwell was then dismissed for a duck from her seventh delivery, cutting Nicola Browne into the hands of Sophie Devine in the gully, leaving the score at 3/20 in the sixth over. The Australians eventually reached 8/106 from their 20 overs.New Zealand started their chase solidly, but in the fourth over, the tide began to turn when but their captain Aimee Watkins pulled Clea Smith and the catch was taken by a leaping Blackwell at midwicket. In the next over Blackwell ran out Sara McGlashan for 1, after the latter had been in a mix-up with Suzie Bates, leaving New Zealand at 2/19. Later, Blackwell caught Rachel Priest from Nitschke to leave New Zealand at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls. Australia went on to win by three runs.\n\n\n=== 2015 Ashes ===\nIn June 2015, she was named as one of Australia's touring party for the 2015 Women's Ashes in England.\n\n\n=== 2017\u201318 season ===\n\nBlackwell was in Australia's squad for the Women's Ashes.

        "article": "Francois \"Faf\" du Plessis ( DOO-pless-ee; born 13 July 1984) is a South African international cricketer and former captain of the  South Africa national cricket team. \ndu Plessis is a right-handed middle-order batsman and part-time leg spin bowler. He has played South African domestic cricket for Northerns and the Titans, as well as matches for Lancashire County Cricket Club, Chennai Super Kings and Rising Pune Supergiant.\nHe made his Test debut in November 2012, and became the fourth South African to score a Test century on debut. Du Plessis was subsequently also named T20 captain of South Africa for the following  Twenty20 series against New Zealand and confirmed full-time skipper in Feb 2013.Du Plessis took over the Test captaincy in December 2016 and assumed full-time captaincy in all formats of the game in August 2017 after teammate and former captain AB de Villiers relinquished the two limited overs captaincies.On 17 February 2021, Du plessis announced his retirement from Test cricket in order to focus on the 2021 and 2022 ICC men's T20 world cup tournaments.\n\n\n== Domestic and T20 franchise career ==\nDu Plessis was on a 6-month contract with Lancashire for the 2008 season starting in April as a Kolpak player after impressing the board with good performances in the local Nottinghamshire leagues for Mansfield Hosiery Mills and in the Lancashire League for Todmorden. Du Plessis started his Lancashire account by scoring 55 against Durham UCCE before being dismissed by opening bowler Foster. Following his six-month stint with Lancashire, du Plessis signed a new three-year deal with the club. Lancashire coach Mike Watkinson praised du Plessis' fielding, saying \"if there's a better fielder in county cricket I've not seen him this season\". In this regard du Plessis also jointly holds the IPL record for most catches in a single match with 4. In March 2010, it was announced that du Plessis would no longer be allowed to play for Lancashire as a Kolpak player after changes to the Kolpak rules. In 2011, he was signed by the 2010 IPL Champions Chennai Super Kings for US$120,000 at the Indian Premier League player auction.Along with Jonathan Vandiar, Dean Elgar, and Ethi Mbhalati, du Plessis was one of four uncapped players to be named in South Africa's 30-man preliminary squad for the 2011 World Cup. He was named one of the five South Africa Cricket Annual's Players Of The Year in 2011.\nDu Plessis had a very successful season with the Chennai Super Kings scoring 398 runs in IPL 2012. Du Plessis has never got out for a duck in his career, until the qualifier 2 match against KXIP in IPL 2014 having been dismissed for a golden duck.\nIn October 2018, he was named in Paarl Rocks' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. He was the leading run-scorer for the team in the tournament, with 318 runs in nine matches.In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Edmonton Royals franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Paarl Rocks team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. In October 2020, he was drafted by the Colombo Kings for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League to be played from late November to mid-December. Also in November 2020, he was picked by Peshawar Zalmi to feature in the playoffs of the fifth season of the Pakistan Super League, to be held in Karachi later that month following a postponement since March due to COVID-19; Du Plessis was selected in place of Kieron Pollard, who was busy in national duties, marking his debut appearance in the PSL. He appeared only in one match as Zalmi were eliminated from the tournament after losing to Lahore Qalandars in the first eliminator.In February 2021, he was signed by the Quetta Gladiators for the 2021 Pakistan Super League. However, in June 2021, he was ruled out of the tournament due to suffering a concussion, during a PSL match against the Peshawar Zalmi. He sustained a concussion after colliding with his teammate Mohammad Hasnain while attempting to preserve a boundary, and thus injured himself.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Early days ===\nDu Plessis made his ODI debut on 18 January 2011 against India and made unbeaten 60 runs. He was chosen ahead of Albie Morkel for the 2011 World Cup on the Indian Sub-continent and later made his Test debut for South Africa against Australia at the Adelaide Oval in 2012 as the number 6 batsman, replacing the injured JP Duminy.\nHe scored 188 runs in the match and was selected as Man-of-the-match for his resilient performance that ultimately led to the match being drawn and the series being square before the third and final Test in which he scored 78 runs the 1st innings and the last man to be dismissed, taking the South African score to 388 in reply to Australia's 550. In the 2nd innings, he scored a match-saving 110 not out from 376 balls over 466 minutes.\nIn the next test at WACA Ground, he scored a resilient unbeaten 78 from 142 balls to take his team's score to 225 in the 1st innings, from 75/6 with able support from Robin Peterson (31 off 45), Vernon Philander (30 from 54) and last man Morne Morkel (17 from 15). South Africa won the 3-match Test Series against Australia 1\u20130. In December 2012, he was named captain of the South African T20 team for three matches against New Zealand.In October 2013, he was fined 50% of his match fee after being found guilty of ball tampering in a Test match against Pakistan.In December 2013, he scored a test match saving hundred with a score of 134 off 309 balls against India while chasing 458 to win in the 4th innings. The match ended in a draw with South Africa on 450/7, only 8 runs short from what would have been the highest successful run chase in test match history. Du Plessis made his maiden ODI hundred on 27 August 2014 against Australia after scoring 106 off 98 balls while chasing 327 runs to win. His partnership of 206 runs with AB de Villiers for the 3rd wicket is the highest for South Africa against Australia.\nHe was also named in the T20I XI by Cricinfo for his performances in 2013.His second Hundred came only 6 days later in his next ODI match on 2 September 2014. He scored 126 from 109 balls against the same opposition although South Africa lost by 62 runs. After making his maiden ODI hundred on 27 August 2014, and a consecutive ODI hundred on 2 September 2014, Du Plessis followed with a third consecutive ODI hundred, scoring 121 off 140 balls, this time against Zimbabwe on 4 September 2014. (South Africa were playing an ODI tri-series with Australia and Zimbabwe.)\nOn 6 September 2014 against Australia, Du Plessis fell only 4 runs short of becoming the first batsman in history to score 4 ODI hundreds in a row. (This would also have been a record for the most ODI hundreds by a batsman in any ICC ODI tournament) He initially looked on course to achieve his 4th ODI hundred until his batting partner AB de Villiers hit 2 sixes and a four in quick succession, which meant Du Plessis had to obtain all the remaining runs in the game single-handedly if he was to reach this milestone. Needing only 1 run to win the game with plenty of wickets and balls in hand, Du Plessis was on 96 and therefore had to hit a boundary (barring any extras) in order to reach 4 ODI hundreds in a row, but while attempting to hit a boundary he was caught off the bowling of Australia's spear-head Mitchell Johnson.  South Africa still went on to win the ODI match against Australia comfortably by 6 wickets. This victory also secured South Africa as the winners of the ODI tri-series, and Du Plessis subsequently became Man of the Series.\nOn 17 December 2014, Du Plessis set the record for playing the most number of international cricket innings before scoring a duck (108) and also became the only batsman to play in over 100 international innings before first ever duck. On 27 December 2014, Du Plessis scored his second first innings century at the same ground: St. George's Oval. On 11 January 2015, du Plessis scored 119 in 56 balls against West Indies, becoming the first South African to score centuries in all forms of the game.\n\n\n=== Record breaking year ===\nFor the 2016\u201317 Australian tour of South Africa to play five ODIs, du Plessis was named captain after original skipper AB de Villiers ruled out due to a surgery. On 2 October, du Plessis scored his sixth century in the second game and became the second cricketer to score centuries in all international formats as captain, after Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan. During that same match at Johannesburg, du Plessis become the first batsman to score centuries in all three formats of cricket at a single venue. Till April 2018, he has scored 17 international centuries (seven Test, nine ODI and one T20I) and is the first South African to score a century in all international formats).\nDu Plessis is the first player to score a century in an innings of a day/night Test as captain. In the same game he set the record for declaration of the lowest ever total ever as an unbeaten captain, where he remained unbeaten on 118 in South Africa's first innings score of 259/9 dec.On 12 December 2016, with AB de Villiers stepping down as Test Captain, du Plessis also inherited the role.On 7 February 2017, du Plessis scored 185 runs in the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka, the second highest individual score by a South African, just three runs short of Gary Kirsten's 188*.\n\n\n=== Captaincy and beyond ===\nOn 24 August 2017, ODI captain De Villiers stepped down from captaincy and Du Plessis was named as the captain in all three formats. On the same day, he was named as the captain of World XI team for the three T20Is in Lahore, Pakistan. Pakistan won the series 2\u20131. Following the conclusion of the series, Faf du Plessis said how much it meant for the people of Pakistan and that it hopefully will bring cricket back to the country.In March 2019, in the second ODI against Sri Lanka, Du Plessis scored his 5,000th run in ODI cricket. The following month, he was named as the captain of South Africa's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer for South Africa, with 387 runs in nine matches.In August 2019, he was named the Men's Cricketer of the Year at Cricket South Africa's annual award ceremony. In December 2020, in the first Test against Sri Lanka, du Plessis scored his 4,000th run and his tenth century in Test cricket. He ended with 199, becoming the 13th player to be dismissed on 199 in Tests, and also won the man of the match award.On 17 February 2021, Du plessis announced his retirement from Tests after leading South Africa in 36 Test matches. \n\n\n=== Centuries ===\nFaf du Plessis has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 10 occasions in Test, 12 occasions in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and once in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nHe scored his first century in November 2012 against Australia on his debut, in the second innings of test match, in which he scored unbeaten 110 runs. His highest Test score came in December 2020 against Sri Lanka when he scored 199 in Centurion.It was over three years later in his 51st ODI that he made his first ODI century, scoring 106 against Australia in Harare. His highest ODI score of 185 runs came on 7 February 2017, against Sri Lanka in Cape Town. During the course of the innings, he set the record for the second highest ODI score after 188 of Gary Kirsten.He scored his maiden T20I century against the West Indies in January 2015, becoming the first South African to score centuries in all three formats of the game.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\n\n=== Ball tampering ===\nTwice, du Plessis has been found guilty of ball tampering during his international career. The first time was during The Oval Test match in 2013 against Pakistan. In 2016, du Plessis was caught again ball tampering during the Hobart Test match against Australia. \nThe first incident against Pakistan involved du Plessis rubbing the ball against a zip on his trousers in order to change the nature of the ball. This was caught on video and du Plessis was subsequently found guilty. He was fined 50% of his match fee. The second incident against Australia involved du Plessis rubbing what looked like a \"lolly\" or mint, on the ball in order to make one side sticky. Du Plessis denied any wrongdoing and he pleaded not guilty to the charge. His teammate Hashim Amla defended him in a statement to the Australian media about the incident stating that the tampering claims were \"a joke\" and called them \"ridiculous\".Regardless of the denials, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering on 21 November 2016. He was subsequently fined 100% of his match fee for the second Test against Australia and he was given three demerit points. Four demerit points within 24 months leads to a one Test or two limited-over games suspension. Du Plessis played the next test and scored a century. The following month he was made captain of the South African cricket team.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDu Plessis attended Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool (Afrikaans High School for Boys, also known as Affies), a public school located in Pretoria. He attended alongside fellow Titans cricketers AB de Villiers, Heino Kuhn and Jacques Rudolph. He is also a graduate of the University of Pretoria. Du Plessis is a second cousin of Namibian rugby player Marcel du Plessis. His father Francois Du Plessis played rugby in the centre position for Northern Transvaal in the 1980s. Du Plessis was featured in the music video for the song \"Maak Jou Drome Waar\", a duet by AB de Villiers and Ampie du Preez.He married his long-time girlfriend Imari Visser in November 2013 at Kleine Zalze. They have a daughter, born in 2017. His sister Rhemi is married to fellow South African international cricketer Hardus Viljoen in December 2019.\nDu Plessis is a Christian. Du Plessis has said, \"I know that my purpose is about more than the runs I score on the cricket field. I hope to be able to spend time with people to show them the love of Jesus and see His love shine through them as well.\"On 17 July 2020, du Plessis released a statement via Instagram, showing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, following fellow Protea player Lungi Ngidi's request for Cricket South Africa to be vocal about the movement and to address racism in cricket. Du Plessis admitted that due to his ignorance, he silenced the struggles of others when he previously stated he does not see colour: \"[I] acknowledge that South Africa is still hugely divided by racism and it is my personal responsibility to do my best to emphasise, hear the stories, learn and then be part of the solution with my thoughts, words and actions\". He concluded his statement, saying \"All lives don't matter UNTIL black lives matter. I'm speaking up now, because if I wait to be perfect, I never will. I want to leave a legacy of empathy. The work needs to continue for the change to come and whether we agree or disagree, conversation is the vehicle for change\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFaf du Plessis at ESPNcricinfo\nFaf du Plessis's profile page on Wisden"

        "article": "Gregory Marc Smith (born 20 April 1983) is a British-South African former cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who formerly played for Essex. He had previously played for Derbyshire for eight years. Since retiring he has moved to Cornwall where he captains and coaches Penzance. In his first year they struggled to find form and lost to Helston 3 times in a season.\nSmith was born in Johannesburg.  His international cricketing career began when he played in the Under-19 World Cup competition of 2002 for South Africa, debuting with a steady bowling performance against Bangladesh in a convincing victory for his side. South Africa were to make it to the final of the competition, in which Smith scored a half-century from the number one batting position, though it was not enough to see his team win the match, as this was countered by a century by New South Wales' Under-19 Australian representative Jarrad Burke.\nSmith made his first appearance in first-class cricket in October 2003, playing for Griqualand West in the 2003\u201304 SuperSport series, in which the team finished in second place in the league. Smith would make one half-century during 2003\u201304, against Boland, and left the team in the summer of 2004.\nDesperate for a County Championship place at a burgeoning team, Smith joined Derbyshire and made his debut Second XI Championship appearance in the same period, in July 2004. However, having scored a duck, he was not to appear again for the side until the 2005 season, where he played in both the Second XI Championship and Trophy.\nSmith made his debut in the County Championship in the 2006 season, scoring steadily with the bat from the middle order and even trying his hand at bowling during the second innings. As Derbyshire finished mid-table during 2006, Smith stepped in for more appearances for the side, and looked promising for the team's future.\nIn 2008, Smith scored the 20th century in the history of the Twenty20 Cup with a 62-ball innings against Yorkshire Carnegie on 12 June 2008. He ended on exactly 100 not out, in a winning performance for Derbyshire.\nThis, as well as other strong performances, led to him being awarded a new contract which will keep him at Derbyshire for a further two years. He has completed his residency period and is looking to qualify as an English player, following a similar path to that of Kevin Pietersen, for example, but in the meantime plays as a Kolpak player.\nDuring the 2011 season, it was announced that he would leave Derbyshire at the end of the season, and in September 2011, he was signed by Essex on a two-year deal, up to the end of the 2013 season. Although continuing with the club after his initial contract ended, he was one of four players released by Essex at the end of the 2015 season. In February 2016 he announced his retirement from first-class cricket, having taken a job as Director of Cricket Development and Head Coach for Penzance Cricket Club.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreg Smith at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nGreg Smith at ESPNcricinfo"

She appeared in one Test match for England in 1949, against Australia. She played domestic cricket for Middlesex.Her one Test came on England's tour of Australia in 1948/49. She was the team's manager, and had to play in the match because of injuries to other players. She made a \"pair\", becoming the first woman to do so on Test debut.Rheinberg was most notable in the women's game as an administrator and journalist. Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, the former England captain, said of her work as an administrator, \"Netta was an action girl. We had very few people then, and she galvanised activity, partly just by having a great personality and a sense of humour.\"\n\"For a north London Jew, playing cricket for England and being one of the game\u2019s most important administrators is about as well-trodden a career path as prime minister or bacon-buttie salesman,\" wrote Rob Steen shortly after her death aged 94 in 2006. \"That Rheinberg happened to be a woman made her accomplishments all the more admirable.\"She was secretary of the Women's Cricket Association in 1945 and from 1948 to 1958. She was also membership secretary and vice-chairman of the Cricket Society. She edited the magazine Women's Cricket, reported on women's cricket for Wisden for more than thirty years, and wrote a regular column for The Cricketer. With Heyhoe-Flint as co-author, she wrote a history of the women's game.In 1999 she was one of the first ten women to be awarded honorary membership of MCC.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNetta Rheinberg at ESPNcricinfo\nNetta Rheinberg at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

        "article": "Paul Andrew Smith born 15 April 1964 in Gosforth, Northumberland is a former English cricketer who played for Warwickshire from 1982 to 1996. He represented England in the Hong Kong and Singapore Sixes.\nA mercurial allrounder, Smith was a big-hitting right-handed batsman, and a genuinely fast right-arm bowler. He made four first-class hundreds in his 221-game career, the first when he was just 19, and in 1986 he became the youngest Warwickshire player to score 1,500 runs in a season. He was a key player in the side which won an unprecedented Treble in 1994 (County Championship, Sunday League, and Benson & Hedges trophy), taking the Man of the Match award in the final of the Benson & Hedges trophy against Worcestershire. The following year, in 1995, he again played an important role as Warwickshire completed the double of County Championship and Natwest Trophy. In all, Smith played in six Lord's one-day finals during his career.\nAlong with opening partner Andy Moles, Smith holds a world record, after the pair shared eight consecutive opening partnerships of 50-plus. In first-class cricket, he scored a total of 8,173 runs at 26.44, with a best of 140.  With the ball, he took 283 wickets at 35.72, which included two hat-tricks and a best of 6 for 91.  Always a potent force in the one-day game, able to turn a match with bat or ball, he won three titles with Warwickshire in the 50-over game, and won all domestic trophies several times. His one-day career saw him amass combined totals 4,430 runs and 234 wickets.\nLate in his career, Smith drew great pride from becoming the first white cricketer to play for Cape Town club St. Augustine\u2019s during the dismantling of apartheid. This sprang directly from the recommendation of former Warwickshire coach, the late Bob Woolmer, and carried a cultural significance as St. Augustine\u2019s C.C. had famously once been the cricketing home of the legendary Basil D\u2019Oliviera.\nHe retired in 1996, and soon afterwards was quoted in a Sunday tabloid as having admitted to drug use in the latter stages of his career. The ECB subsequently banned him for two years.  Smith formed CWB (Cricket Without Boundaries) with Pertemps Group Chairman Tim Watts, with the aim of linking sport to the classroom and then employment. CWB saw a 40% participant return to work. Other projects he initiated included Coachright, who linked sport to academic accreditation. Over 150 schools and 20 community groups benefited from the initiative.\nHe struggled with life after cricket, and moved to America for a time, where he became involved with the Compton Cricket Club in Los Angeles, which seeks to use the spirit and disciplines of cricket to turn youngsters away from crime. This led to Smith being awarded a Certificate of Appreciation from Los Angeles City in 2003. He also works with the Prince's Trust in the U.K.\nIn 2007, Smith published a revealing autobiography entitled Wasted?, described by one reviewer as \"far from a conventional read\" and a work of \"refreshing honesty\".The book was nominated for the shortlist of the Sunday Times Newspaper Book of the Year Award.\n\n\n== Media Work ==\nWrote a weekly article for the Birmingham Post 1998 \u2013 1999 \u2013 2000. Has since written articles for a variety of magazines.\nHas a Hospitality room named after him at Edgbaston Cricket Ground.\nGlobal Ambassador for the Compton Cricket Club.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo Profile\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWasted?, by Paul Smith, published by Know the score books (2007), ISBN 978-1-905449-45-3"

Spencer's first cricketing appearances came as part of an England A side playing against a Western Australia XI during an Australian tour in 1993.\nSpencer's debut first-class match came in the 1993 County Championship, though he only played one further match before signing for Western Australia in time for the 1994 Sheffield Shield. Just three months after the end of the competition, he played once again in the County Championship, though he made little impact in the four games in which he played and Kent finished the season in midtable as Spencer dropped out of the county game with back trouble, but not before Sir Vivian Richards rated Spencer as the fastest bowler he had ever faced.After six years out of the Western Australian side, he returned to play six one-day matches for WA in the 2000/01 season and after the last of these matches, he returned a positive drug test to the anabolic steroid nandrolone.  He was found guilty and suspended from all competitive cricket for 18 months.  Spencer claimed that it was taken to relieve the pain caused by chronic back injuries.Spencer returned to sign for Sussex at the age of 34, signing for the start of the 2006 County Championship season. However, Spencer played just one County Championship match following his return, moving to Minor Counties outfit Buckinghamshire during the second half of the season.\nSpencer was on the losing side of the 2006 Minor Counties Championship final. Throughout his career, he played as a lower-order batsman, particularly during his matches in England.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDuncan Spencer at Cricket Archive (subscription required)"

BBC2 divided the series into 5 parts of slightly varying lengths.The individual original BBC2 episode run-times of the Bodyline mini-series were:\n\n3/6/1985:  Part 1 \u2013 85 minutes\n4/6/1985:  Part 2 \u2013 89 minutes\n5/6/1985:  Part 3 \u2013 88 minutes\n6/6/1985:  Part 4 \u2013 89 minutes\n7/6/1985:  Part 5 \u2013 85 minutesTotal extended run-time: 436 minutes \u2013 7 hours 16 minutes.\nWhen originally shown on Channel 10 Australia in July 1984 over 4 consecutive nights - including extensive ad-breaks - the run-time was approx. 10 hours. Excluding ad breaks: the actual run-time is 7 hours 16 minutes. IMDb and Amazon give the total run-time of the official extensively cut, re-edited and picture-cropped - from the original 4:3 picture ratio to a 16:9 picture ratio - widescreen presentation DVD version as 330 minutes \u2013 5 hours 30 minutes \u2013 7 episodes of approx. 47 minutes each - a total of 329 minutes.\nTherefore, the original version transmitted in its entirety by BBC2 Television in June 1985 is approximately 1 hour 46 minutes longer than the official Australian DVD version of Bodyline. BBC2 had licence for UK premiere broadcast and one repeat showing before transmission rights reverted to Australian TV Network 10 and Kennedy-Miller for DVD production.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"The Dictionary of Performing Arts in Australia \u2014 Theatre .

        "article": "Single wicket cricket is a form of cricket played between two individuals, who take turns to bat and bowl against each other. The one bowling is assisted by a team of fielders, who remain as fielders at the change of innings. The winner is the one who scores more runs. There was considerable interest in single wicket during the middle part of the 18th century when it enjoyed top-class status. \nAlmost never seen professionally today, it is most often encountered in local cricket clubs, in which there are a number of knockout rounds leading to a final. The exact rules can vary according to local practice: for example, a player might be deducted runs for an out rather than ending his or her innings. An innings typically is limited to two or three overs. When single wicket was popular in the 18th century, however, there was no overs limitation, and a player's innings ended only on his dismissal.\n\n\n== History ==\nSingle wicket has known periods of huge success when it was more popular than the eleven-a-side version of cricket. This was especially so among gamblers at the Artillery Ground during the middle years of the 18th century. Star performers at the time included Robert Colchin, Stephen Dingate, Tom Faulkner and Thomas Waymark.\nIt was in a single-wicket match on 22\u201323 May 1775 that Surrey bowler Lumpy Stevens beat Hampshire batsman John Small three times with the ball going through the two stump wicket of the day. As a result of Stevens' protests, the patrons agreed that a third stump should be added.Despite this famous match, single wicket experienced a lull during the Hambledon Era and in the early years of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but its popularity soared again in the first half of the 19th century, when leading players like Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix took part in some significant matches. From about 1800 to the 1820s, single wicket matches were popular but riddled with gambling-related match fixing.With the rise of the All-England Eleven and a growing interest in county cricket, single wicket lapsed again and has rarely been seen at the highest level since 1850, despite a brief revival in the 1960s. A single wicket competition called the Courage International Batsman of the Year was held at The Oval over two days in September 1979. The event was won by Clive Lloyd, who beat David Gower in the final.The 2020 Ultimate Kricket Challenge was a form of single wicket cricket, in which players competed in head-to-head matches. Runs were scored by hitting into zones; and each player was assisted by a wicket-keeper and one other fielder when they were bowling, as well as being allowed a substitute bowler for up to 7 balls in each 15 ball innings. The inaugural tournament was won by Rashid Khan, who defeated Andre Russell in the final.\n\n\n== Alternative definition ==\nIn an 1831 issue of New Sporting Magazine, \"single wicket\" cricket was not a one-on-one competition, but was defined as cricket with less than five players per team. In this modified form, runs could only be scored by hitting the ball to an area forward of the wicket, halving the zone in which runs could be scored. Otherwise the rules were similar to ordinary cricket, which the publication referred to as \"double wicket\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMore Than a Game by John Major\nScores & Biographies by Arthur Haygarth"

        "article": "Claude Cattermole \"Catsmeat\" Potter-Pirbright is a recurring fictional character in the Jeeves and Drones Club stories of English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a longtime school friend of Jeeves's master Bertie Wooster and a member of the Drones Club. A West End actor known as \"Claude Cattermole\" on stage, he is known to his friends by the nickname \"Catsmeat\".\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character was inspired by the real life actor and county cricketer, Basil Foster, who played against Wodehouse in the Actors against Authors game at Lord's in 1907 (with Wodehouse playing for the Authors XI). Foster portrayed the hero, George Bevan, in the 1928 New Theatre production of A Damsel in Distress, and also played Psmith in the 1930 Shaftesbury Theatre production of Leave It to Psmith; both productions were adapted by Wodehouse and Ian Hay from novels written by Wodehouse.\n\n\n== Life and character ==\nThe son of a theatrical music writer and a New York actress named Elsie Cattermole, Claude Cattermole \"Catsmeat\" Potter-Pirbright is the brother of actress Cora \"Corky\" Pirbright, who is also known by her stage name, Cora Starr. Catsmeat is engaged to Gertrude Winkworth, the daughter of Dame Daphne Winkworth. Catsmeat and Bertie Wooster went together to Malvern House Preparatory School, where Catsmeat was described in a report by the headmaster Aubrey Upjohn as \"brilliant but unsound\". He was also with Bertie at secondary school at Eton, and at the University of Oxford. Catsmeat's nickname is probably derived at least in part from the similarity of \"Cattermole\" to \"cat's meat\" (meaning meat prepared for cats).\nInspired by the successful theatrical careers of his parents and sister, Catsmeat, seeking a profession that would provide him with an income and spare time to play county cricket, chose to become an actor after his time at Oxford. He generally performs in comedies, playing the role of the hero's light-hearted friend carrying the second love interest. According to Bertie, Catsmeat is a very lively individual both on and off the stage. His sprightliness is a byword among his friends. Catsmeat is also known for being a fashionable dresser; in Uncle Fred in the Springtime, he is described as a \"modern Brummel\".Catsmeat is first mentioned in Thank You, Jeeves, when Bertie, impressed by the effect that Jeeves's eloquence often has on the language of others, recalls a time when Catsmeat came to stay at Bertie's flat for a week, \"and the very second day he said something to me about gauging somebody's latent potentialities. And Catsmeat a fellow who had always thought you were kidding him when you assured him that there were words in the language that had more than one syllable.\" In Right Ho, Jeeves, Bertie remembers an instance when Catsmeat made noise with a police rattle behind Bertie's chair at the Drones, though Bertie actually enjoyed the noise.In The Code of the Woosters, it is mentioned that Catsmeat is among those who attend Gussie Fink-Nottle's pre-wedding dinner at the Drones Club, where Bertie Wooster keeps Catsmeat from giving his imitation of Beatrice Lillie. In Joy in the Morning, Catsmeat is responsible for a mix-up involving a \"Borstal Rovers\" football outfit he intended to wear to a costume party.His most prominent role is in the Jeeves novel The Mating Season, during which he gets Gussie Fink-Nottle to climb fully clothed into the Trafalgar Square fountain. In that novel, he pretends to be Bertie's valet, calling himself Meadowes, and inadvertently becomes temporarily engaged to Queenie Silversmith. He also appears in \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\", in which he and Bertie discuss the theatrical agent, Jas Waterbury.\nCatsmeat collaborates with Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps to write an article titled \"Some Little-Known Cocktails\" for Wee Tots, a family publication edited by Bingo Little, and they present it to Bingo in \"The Shadow Passes\". Ultimately, Catsmeat plans to go to Hollywood.\n\n\n== Appearances ==\nCatsmeat is featured in:\n\nLord Emsworth and Others (1937)\n\"The Masked Troubadour\" (1936) \u2013 Drone Freddie Widgeon\nThe Mating Season (1949) \u2013 Jeeves\nNothing Serious (1950)\n\"The Shadow Passes\" (1950) \u2013 Drone Bingo Little\nPlum Pie (1966)\n\"Stylish Stouts\" (1965) \u2013 Drone Bingo Little\n\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\" (1965) \u2013 JeevesCatsmeat is mentioned in:\n\nThank You, Jeeves (1934) \u2013 Jeeves\nRight Ho, Jeeves (1934) \u2013 Jeeves\nThe Luck of the Bodkins (1935) \u2013 Drone Monty Bodkin\nThe Code of the Woosters (1938) \u2013 Jeeves\nUncle Fred in the Springtime (1939) \u2013 Blandings\nJoy in the Morning (1946) \u2013 Jeeves\nA Few Quick Ones (1959)\n\"Oofy, Freddie and the Beef Trust\" (1949, first published as \"Freddie, Oofy and the Beef Trust\") \u2013 Drone Freddie Widgeon\n\"The Fat of the Land\" (1958) \u2013 Drone Freddie Widgeon\nJeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954) \u2013 Jeeves\nJeeves in the Offing (1960) \u2013 Jeeves\nMuch Obliged, Jeeves (1971) \u2013 Jeeves\nAunts Aren't Gentlemen (1974) \u2013 Jeeves (ch. 14)\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nTelevisionJohn Elmes portrayed Catsmeat in the 1990\u20131993 television series Jeeves and Wooster in series 3, episode 4.RadioKenneth Fortescue voiced Catsmeat in an adaptation of The Mating Season in the 1973\u20131981 series, What Ho!

In particular, players have been approached by bookmakers and bribed to throw matches or aspects of matches (such as the toss), or provide other essential information. Fixing has happened in both international - including Test matches and One Day Internationals - and domestic cricket. The ban is issued by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's governing body, or by the respective cricket board(s) to which the player belongs.

He was a left-handed opening batsman. In February 2017, he was suspended and later banned for one year for his part in the 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal. In August 2018, he was banned for a further ten years by an independent anti-corruption tribunal. In February 2020, he was jailed for seventeen months after pleading guilty.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== First-class career ===\nNasir made his first-class debut at the age of just 15 and was soon selected to the Pakistan Under-19 cricket team for a series against Sri Lanka, making 204 in the second innings on his debut. At Twenty20 level, he made his debut for the Lahore Lions in April 2005, at the age of 15 years and 140 days, making him the then youngest ever player to play in Twenty20 matches.In the 2005\u201306 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy series he scored over 800 runs and earned selection in the Patron's XI side to play Zimbabwe. He made 182 runs and within a week was playing ODI cricket for Pakistan.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nIn his debut against Zimbabwe, he opened the batting and smashed 61 off just 48 deliveries which saw him win the Man of the Match award. In his second ODI, he hit 74 off 64 balls, becoming only third Pakistani to make consecutive half centuries in first and second matches.\nIn the 2008 Asia Cup, Jamshed scored two consecutive half centuries, 53 runs against India before he was retired hurt and 52 not out against Bangladesh, at the National Stadium, Karachi. From these performances, he has really strengthened his position as an opener in the Pakistani ODI squad. During the Asia Cup 2008 Jamshed's fitness was questioned by the commentators and he visibly seemed over weight. This lack of fitness also lead him to miss the following Twenty20 tournament in Canada, and a 3 match ODI series against the West Indies. His exclusion from the national team continued in January 2009 when he was passed over for Khurram Manzoor during the Sri Lanka ODI series.\nHe made his first one-day international century against India on 18 March 2012 in Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Mirpur at the 2012 Asia Cup. He scored 112 off just 104 balls and was involved in a 224 run partnership with Mohammad Hafeez, which is the second best opening partnership for Pakistan against any team and first best partnership against India in one day internationals.  They eclipsed Aamer Sohail and Saeed Anwar's record of 144 runs which was made in 1996. He had a poor ICC World Cup 2015 in which he was dismissed in the single figures thrice and  frequently struggled with the pull shot.\n\n\n=== T20 Career ===\nIn 2009 he along with veteran Abdul Razzaq set the highest 3rd wicket partnership ever in any forms of T20s(162)\n\n\n== Fixing allegations and bans ==\nIn February 2017 he was provisionally suspended under the PCB's Anti-Corruption Code as part of an ongoing investigation of the 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal, and was arrested by Britain's National Crime Agency shortly after. He was banned for one year by PCB on 11 December 2017.In August 2018, he was banned for a further ten years by an independent anti-corruption tribunal. Jamshed also became ineligible to hold an official position in the Pakistan Cricket Board. In October 2018, an independent adjudicator upheld Jamshed's ban. In February 2019, Jamshed, along with two other men, pleaded not guilty at Manchester Crown Court in England, after they were accused of bribery relating to the Pakistan Super League. However, in December 2019 on the first day of his trial, Jamshed changed his plea to guilty. Initially Jamshed was the target of bribery but then acted as a go-between, encouraging others in return for money. In February 2020, Jamshed was jailed for seventeen months, after pleading guilty.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJamshed is married to a British citizen Samara Afzal who is based in Birmingham, England. They have a daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Nasir Jamshed\". Yahoo! Cricket."

        "article": "Johannes Gerhardus Myburgh (born 22 October 1980) is a former British-South African cricketer who played domestic cricket in England for Somerset County Cricket Club.\nA right-handed batsman and occasional off break bowler, Myburgh was also a talented fielder, and is the current holder of the record for the youngest scorer of a double-century in South African domestic cricket, breaking the record of Graeme Pollock in 1997 when aged 17.Though born in South Africa, he emigrated to New Zealand in 2007, where he planned to qualify for the national team. Myburgh has since abandoned his New Zealand ambitions and moved to the UK, where he has played for Hampshire and Durham. He joined his third English county, Somerset, in 2014.In 2021, he was named as Head Coach of the South East Stars.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nMyburgh was born in Pretoria, along with his brother Stephan, who has played international cricket for the Netherlands. Myburgh made his first-class debut in 1997 for Northerns B. Myburgh played four Under-19 Test matches and seventeen Under-19 ODIs for South Africa, including all six of the team's matches during the 1998 World Cup, which took place in South Africa.After two years playing for Northerns B, Myburgh was elevated to the full Northerns side for the 1999/00 season. On 7 January 2001, during a one-day game, he scored an opening partnership of 156 with Jacques Rudolph before being dismissed for 95. On 15 October 2004 he scored 102 against Easterns during a first-class match, and on 9 January 2005 he scored 100* against Border. Myburgh first played for the Titans, the franchise formed from the merger of the Northerns and Easterns, in the 2004/05 season. Late in 2005, Myburgh scored 56* against the Warriors, and he became the Titans' leading run scorer in the Standard Bank Cup in 2005/06, hitting 237 runs in ten matches with a high score of 59*.In 2006, playing for Northerns, Myburgh scored a 50 as they faced Western Province on 8 April, and then scored another 55-ball 50 against the South African national cricket team in September.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn 2007, Myburgh emigrated to New Zealand, in order to replace the retiring Nathan Astle at Canterbury. Myburgh was aware that he needed to play only three seasons in New Zealand to qualify for their national team. He quickly cemented his place in the Canterbury side when he scored 148* off 154 balls with four sixes as his team moved on to 344/1, and followed this with another century in December, a fifty in January 2008, and a 98-ball 87 in February against England.\n\n\n=== England ===\nAfter three years with Canterbury, Myburgh was originally due to sign for Auckland for the 2010/11 season, but he declined his contract offer in order to pursue a career in England, to where he relocated, living with his English wife. If he had played one further season in New Zealand, he would have been eligible to play international cricket for New Zealand. In contrast, he would only become eligible for the England team after four seasons in England. Myburgh joined Hampshire as a Kolpak registration, making his debut for the county in the 2010\u201311 Caribbean Twenty20, in which the county ended as runners-up. After one season with Hampshire, Myburgh was released by the county, having not played for the first team since May. He later signed for Durham for their 2012 Friends Life t20 campaign. Myburgh's contract with Durham was extended until the end of the season, following impressive performances during the FLt20.Myburgh spent much of the summer of 2013 playing club cricket as captain of Sutton CC, a team in the Surrey Premier League. He had previously played for the same side in three matches in 2003.Myburgh signed for Somerset, his third English county, for the 2014 season. He rejoined Director of Cricket Dave Nosworthy, who was previously coach for the Titans and Canterbury whilst Myburgh played for those teams. Myburgh scored a century on the opening day of the 2015 season at home to Middlesex and enjoyed success as an opener in the Natwest T20 Blast in the same season. He signed a white-ball contract for 2018, to play in the One-Day Cup and the T20 Blast. In August 2018, Myburgh announced his intention to retire at the end of the season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohann Myburgh at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Wayne Dillon Parnell (born 30 July 1989) is a South African professional cricketer who most recently played for Northamptonshire in English county cricket. \nPreviously, he played Test cricket, One Day International cricket and Twenty20 matches for South Africa. At domestic level he played for Cape Cobras, having previously played for the Warriors and Eastern Province. \n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nParnell was born in Port Elizabeth in 1989. He attended Grey High School in his home town, leaving in 2007. He studied Human Resource Management at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth.\n\n\n== Domestic cricket ==\nParnell made his first-class cricket debut for Eastern Province in October 2006, at the age of seventeen, against South Western Districts scoring 17 and taking one wicket. In his second first-class match, he recorded figures of four for seven, and, in only his fifth first-class match, he took a hat-trick against Western Province: all three batsman were bowled. He was described as  \u201cthe most talked about cricketer to hit the first-class scene for some time.\"In 2008 Parnell was awarded the Coca-Cola Khaya Majola U19 Player of the Tournament and the CSA U19 Cricketer of the Year while representing Eastern Province.\n\n\n=== County cricket ===\nAt the start of the 2009 season Parnell was signed as an overseas player by Kent County Cricket Club on a six-week contract, serving as a replacement for Stuart Clark. On his county debut against Essex he took 4/78 in the first innings and top scored with 69 in the second, his maiden first-class fifty, going on to better this score in Kent's next County championship match, against Glamorgan with an innings of 90. Parnell left Kent to join up with South Africa ahead of the 2009 World Twenty20 but after the tournament he returned for a further five weeks. Though returning to South Africa after his second spell ended, Parnell was cleared by Cricket South Africa to return to Kent and played for the county on the competition's finals day.In 2011 Parnell played for Sussex County Cricket Club for the second half of the season although \"he struggled for fitness and form\" during his spell with the county. In 2015 he played for Glamorgan in eight matches in the 2015 NatWest t20 Blast group stages before joining South Africa on their tour of Bangladesh. Parnell missed the first two matches of his planned ten with Glamorgan due to a groin injury.Parnell joined Kent again in April 2017 for the first part of the 2017 season. He was available for the first weeks of the 2017 County Championship and 2017 Royal London One-Day Cup matches until South Africa began their tour of England in May.In September 2018, Parnell signed a Kolpak deal with Worcestershire, making him unavailable to play international cricket. He was released by Worcestershire at the end of the 2020 season following the abolition of Kolpak status. He was picked up by Northamptonshire for the 2021 season as an overseas player and took ten wickets in his second match for the side against Yorkshire. In April 2021, he was named in Western Province's squad, ahead of the 2021\u201322 cricket season in South Africa.\n\n\n== Franchise Twenty20 cricket ==\nParnell was bought the Delhi Daredevils in auction for the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL), after they outbid the Deccan Chargers for his services. He was signed for a price that far exceeded his reserve price set at the start of the auction, becoming the third highest paid South African cricketer in the tournament but did not appear in any matches for Delhi during the season.Parnell went on to play for Pune Warriors in the IPL from 2011 to 2013 before returning to Delhi to play for the Daredevils during the 2014 season. Whilst a Pune player he was one of 90 people detained by police after a rave party he was attending in a Mumbai suburb was raided in 2012. Parnell subsequently appeared in court and was bailed on drugs related charges. A further procedural court appearance took place whilst Parnell was in the South African squad for the 2014 World T20 competition which took place in India. Parnell claimed he was innocent of any drug taking.During the 2016 Caribbean Premier League Parnell played for the Barbados Tridents.\nOn 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Edmonton Royals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. He was the joint-leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Edmonton Royals, with six dismissals in six matches.In September 2018, he was named in Kabul's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker for Kabul Zwanan in the tournament, with thirteen dismissals in ten matches.\n\n\n== International cricket ==\n\nParnell was selected as captain of the South Africa team for the 2008 U/19 Cricket World Cup having also played for the team in 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup. He finished the 2008 tournament as the leading wicket-taker with 18 wickets at 8.38. In the quarter-final against Bangladesh he took six for eight as well as top-scoring with 57.Parnell was selected in the ODI and T20 squads for South Africa's tour of Australia in 2008\u201309, and made his international debut in the second Twenty20 International at Brisbane on 13 January 2009. He was expensive with the ball and put down a crucial catch, but it was later suggested that this was the result of a green laser light beamed into his eyes by a member of the crowd. He thus became the youngest player to be handed a national contract by Cricket South Africa (CSA).Parnell was included in South Africa's squad for the third and final Test against Australia in Cape Town and although he wasn't selected, he was again named for the Twenty20 and ODI series which followed. Sharing the new ball with Dale Steyn, he played a key role in South Africa's seven-wicket win in the second ODI at Centurion by taking four for 25.In May 2009 Parnell was selected in the South African squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in England.

        "article": "Sunette Stella Viljoen (born 6 October 1983) is a South African sportswoman who has represented her country in both cricket and athletics. In athletics, she competes as a javelin thrower and has won an Olympic silver medal (in 2016) and two Commonwealth Games gold medals (in 2006 and 2010), as well as medals in various other competitions. As a cricketer, she represented the South African national team between 2000 and 2002, including at the 2000 World Cup in New Zealand.\n\n\n== Early life and cricket career ==\nViljoen was born in Rustenburg, Transvaal (present-day North West). She attended Die Ho\u00ebrskool Rustenburg and her first language is Afrikaans. Viljoen made her international cricket debut for South Africa in June 2000, in a One Day International (ODI) match against England. She was 17 years and 10 days old at the time, becoming the youngest woman to play ODI cricket for South Africa (a record since broken by several others). Later in the year, Viljoen was selected in the South African squad for the 2000 Women's World Cup in New Zealand. A right-handed all-rounder, she appeared in all eight of her team's matches at the tournament, and against England scored 54 not out, which was to be the highest score of her ODI career. Against Ireland in a later match, she took 3/27 from ten overs, the best bowling figures of her international career. Viljoen's final international matches for South Africa came in March 2002, in a home series against India. She played four ODIs and the only Test match of her career, in which she scored 17 runs in the first innings and 71 in the second (the third-highest score of the match).\n\n\n== Athletics career ==\n\nViljoen won gold at the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, throwing 62.52 metres. At the qualifying round, she set a new African record 65.46 metres, eclipsing her compatriot Justine Robbeson's record 63.49m achieved in Potchefstroom in February 2008. Viljoen's throw was over three meters further than her previous PB of 62.24 m achieved also at the February 2008 meeting in Potchefstroom. On 14 June 2010, she broke her own record with 66.38 m at the Josef Odlo\u017eil Memorial in Prague.Viljoen won silver at the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, Korea on 2 September 2011. With a throw of 68.38m, she also set a new African record. She improved her own African record to 69.35m at the Adidas Grand Prix in New York City in June 2012  Having failed to reach the final at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, she finished fourth at the 2012 Summer Olympics, only 0.38 cm off the bronze medal winning mark.At the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, which was held in Moscow, Viljoen took only the 6th place with a mark of 63.58 meters. In 2014, she placed second at the Commonwealth Games. Later that year she won the African Championships with a result of 65.32m. Viljoen won a silver medal, coming in second to Israel's Marharyta Dorozhon, at the IAAF Diamond League Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway, on 11 June 2015.Viljoen won the silver medal in the women's javelin at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.\n\n\n== Competition record ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSunette Viljoen at World Athletics\nSunette Viljoen at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nSunette Viljoen at ESPNcricinfo"

He is a right-arm medium pace bowler who bowls consistently at around 130 km/h and relies on accuracy, and bats left-handed. He is banned from taking part in any official cricket matches after being found guilty of spot-fixing in domestic matches. He played Ranji Trophy for Madhya Pradesh and represented Delhi Giants and Deccan Chargers in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) and the Indian Premier League (IPL) respectively.\n\n\n== Early career and personal life ==\nSudhindra was born in Hindupur, Andhra Pradesh to middle class parents. His family currently resides in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. In his early playing days Sudhindra used to keep wickets, but subsequently took up bowling on his coach's advice. Sudhindra took a break from cricket in class 12 to go to Pune for a degree in commerce and to later pursue a management course. But his father's financial position forced him to pursue his studies from Bhilai. Back in his hometown, Sudhindra resumed playing cricket and was selected to play for Chhattisgarh in the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup. A second break from Cricket happened when Sudhindra started preparing for the Chartered Accountancy exam. Unable to clear the exam, he resumed his Cricket career again. Sudhindra was selected for the MP Under-22 side in 2003. The call-up to the MP senior side arrived in 2005\u201306, after Sudhindra's impressive performance at the U-22 level.\n\n\n== First Class Cricket ==\nSudhindra made his first class debut in 2005 against Jharkhand at Indore. He played 27 first-class games, representing Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy. After returning to domestic Cricket in 2009, Sudhindra picked up 25 wickets for his side in the Plate Division of the Ranji Trophy in the 2010\u201311 season. His splendid work with the shining and rough ball took Madhya Pradesh to the knockout stage of the Elite Division of the Ranji Trophy in the 2011\u201312 season. He was the leading wicket-taker for that season with 40 wickets at an average of 18.70.\n\n\n== Indian Cricket League ==\nA precarious financial situation at home forced Sudhindra to look towards the rebel Indian Cricket League. Sudhindra was signed up by the Delhi Giants and also represented the Indian World Team in the ICL. In 2009, he returned to the domestic fray after the BCCI granted amnesty to 79 Indian players who had ended their association with the ICL.\n\n\n== Indian Premier League ==\nSudhindra earned an IPL contract with Deccan Chargers in 2012 on the back of an impressive Ranji Trophy season for Madhya Pradesh. He played three games for the Chargers in the fifth edition of IPL. Sudhindra had a disastrous outing in the tournament, picking up only one wicket and going for an economy rate of more than 11 in each of his three games. Other bowlers of his team did not fare well either. After his name cropped up in a spot-fixing incident, he was suspended by his franchise pending further enquiry.\n\n\n== Spot-fixing controversy and subsequent ban ==\nOn 14 May 2012, Indian television channel India TV aired a sting operation showing Sudhindhra confessing to having bowled a no-ball in a domestic game at the TV channel's insistence and boasting that spot-fixing could be done at any level of Indian cricket, including IPL. The said no-ball was bowled by Sudhindra in the Madhya Pradesh Premier League T20 tournament. Sudhindra was also shown as saying that franchisees were giving players cars and flats since the IPL had capped remunerations for first-class players. Following the sting operation, Sudhindra (along with four other domestic players) was suspended by the BCCI pending completion of enquiry. The case was investigated by Ravi Sawani, who submitted his report to the BCCI's disciplinary committee. The committee held Sudhindra guilty of actually receiving a consideration to spot-fix in a domestic cricket match, and imposed exemplary penalty of a life-ban on him. Sudhindra has been debarred from playing any cricket matches conducted or authorized by the ICC or BCCI, or any affiliated unit of the BCCI. He will not be entitled to the monthly gratis, benevolent fund, benefit match or any other facility, in lieu of. Further, he cannot hold any position in any cricket association affiliated to the BCCI, for life.Sudhindra admitted his guilt but plans to take the BCCI to court over the stiff penalties imposed on him.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTP Sudhindra at ESPNcricinfo\nMadhya Pradesh thrash Tripura\nT Sudhindra\nSudhindra's best catch"

        "article": "Wilson the Wonder Athlete was a British comic strip, first published in 1943 in the British illustrated story paper The Wizard published by D. C. Thomson & Co.. It follows the sporting adventures of a heroic character named William Wilson. The stories were written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton and drawn by Jack Glass. The stories ran until 1984 in various British magazines.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe character first appeared in issue 1029 Wizard (24 July 1943) in a story titled \"The Truth About Wilson\". The first adventure introduced Wilson as a supreme athlete, who joins a race from out of the crowd and manages to record a three-minute mile. The character's adventures were written by Gilbert Lawford Dalton using the pen name W S K Webb, and a book, The Truth About Wilson collected a number of the text stories in the 1960s. Thought by Paul Gravett to be the prototype of the \"astonishing sporting prodigies\" who became popular in British comics, (cf. Alf Tupper, Roy of the Rovers), Gravett describes him as an \"unassuming totally dedicated loner, [wanting] no glory or publicity\". Although his stories were initially told in prose, a move to the comic papers The Hornet and  Hotspur saw the character depicted in comic strip form. The character was later revived for D.C. Thomson's Spike comic of 1983 to 1984, initially within a comic strip with art by Neville Wilson.  Referred to as The Man in Black, the character was revealed to be Wilson in the course of the story, with reprints of the older material published within the comic as Wilson's diaries.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nWilliam Wilson was born in the village of Stayling in Yorkshire and claimed to be born on 1 November 1795. However a document dated 11 March 1774 listed him as \"clerk to the manor\". He was sufficiently old that when writing, he used an \"f\" instead of an \"s\". His farmer father died in middle age, leaving Wilson \u00a35,000. He studied medicine and biology in a number of countries around the world and determined not to die early as so many he knew had, he worked out a health and fitness regime and learned how to slow his heart right down, using a formula created by people who could live to over 200. He developed his will power and hardened his body by whole winters spent in the open. Squadron leader W. Wilson D.S.O., D.F.C. and bar, who had 25 victories to his name, was shot down during the Second World War and was officially listed as missing.\nThe character is depicted within stories as performing a number of improbable events. Wilson was seen in one strip becoming the first man to climb Everest, and another saw him captaining an England cricket team to The Ashes in Australia. Originally hailing from Yorkshire, and living in a cave on a diet of nuts and berries, Wilson exemplified British grit and the stiff upper lip.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to The Guardian he \"was hailed as a welcome wartime morale booster\", while The Telegraph remembers him as a \"focused and intense individual ... [with no] recorded instance of him smiling or cracking a joke.\" In 2004 artist John Reynolds acquired the licence to reproduce images of Wilson as large screen-print canvases. Former Guinness Book of Records deputy editor and athletics statistician, Ian Smith, cites the character as an inspiration, and he inspired many British athletes in their careers as well as Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx. The character is still used in newspaper reports on sport as a cultural reference point.\n\n\n== Tributes ==\nComedian and actor Billy Connolly wore a black leotard on stage during the 1970s as a tribute to Wilson.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGallagher, Brendan.

First-class or List A cricket, provincial rugby and international cricket or rugby are considered to be high level for the purposes of this list. To be eligible, players must have appeared for their country's national side in at least one of the sports. The lists below are alphabetical and sorted by the country in which the player spent their international career.\nAlfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury, who organised the first British Isles rugby tour to Australasia in 1888 were also noted cricketers.\nWhile the Wales national rugby union team is a force in international rugby, the Wales national cricket team plays only rarely, and the nation of Wales is usually subsumed under England for cricketing purposes.\nBoth Irish rugby players and cricketers, unlike soccer players, also play as one nation.\nThe two sports have also had a considerable overlap in commentators and journalists, e.g. Robert Hudson, Howard Marshall, Lisa Olson, Denzil Batchelor, Ian Smith, Steve James, Allan Massie\nMany venues, including St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, Carisbrook, Eden Park, Raeburn Place, Headingley Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, McLean Park, The Oval, Cardiff Arms Park and Limavady Cricket and Rugby Club have been used for both rugby and cricket over the years.\nDue to the historical relationship between rugby league and rugby union, several of these players have also competed in high level rugby league as well.

He also captained the Hong Kong cricket team before stepping down in May 2015. A wicket-keeper, he has also represented Hong Kong at Under-19s level, and was selected as part of their squad for the 2010 U-19 Cricket World Cup. He was the first player (either male or female) born in the 1990s to play in ODI cricket as he made his debut at the age of 17 in 2008 against Pakistan during the 2008 Asia Cup. His father Steve played Minor Counties cricket.\nIn 2014, Atkinson captained the Hong Kong team in their first global tournament, the World T20 in Bangladesh, defeating the hosts in their final match after two losses. His highest score was 31 from 20 balls against Afghanistan in Chittagong before getting out LBW.\nIn May 2015, he stepped down as Hong Kong's captain citing lack of form as his main reason. The decision came after he led the side in a 59-run win over Namibia in which he made an unbeaten 37-ball 64 in a T20 match. In April 2019, he was named in Hong Kong's squad for the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament in Namibia. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJames Atkinson at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nJames Atkinson at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "John Edward Raphael (30 April 1882 \u2013 11 June 1917) was a Belgian-born sportsman who was capped nine times for England at rugby union and played first-class cricket with Surrey. He was a Barrister by profession and a  Liberal politician.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRaphael was Jewish, and the son of multi-millionaire financier Albert Raphael, who was part of a banking dynasty that in the 1920s rivalled the Rothschild family, John Raphael was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and St John's College, Oxford. In January 2021, one of the eight pastoral Houses at Merchant Taylors' was re-named in his honour.\n\n\n== Rugby ==\n\nRaphael won his first cap in 1902 when England took on Wales in the Home Nations Championship. A centre, winger or full-back, he also played in the 1905 and 1906 Championships as well as in Test matches against both France and New Zealand. The only points of his career came through a try which he scored in 1906 when playing Scotland. He captained the 1910 British Lions tour to Argentina, which included the South American nation's inaugural Test match.Raphael authored a book Modern Rugby Football\nwhich was published posthumously by his mother in 1918\n\n\n== Cricket ==\nRaphael played his cricket as a specialist batsman and most of his appearances at first-class level were for either Surrey or Oxford University. He also played first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club, Gentlemen of England, London County and an England XI amongst others. Four of Raphael's five centuries were scored for Oxford University, including his career best score of 201 which he made against Yorkshire, who had the bowling of Wilfred Rhodes at their disposal. It remains the only double hundred to be made by an Oxford cricketer against Yorkshire. His only century for Surrey came in the 1904 County Championship, which he captained his county for much of, scoring 111 against Worcestershire. A part-time bowler, his three first-class wickets were of Samuel Coe, Lord Dalmeny and Test cricketer John King.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nRaphael was involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal Party. He stood for the UK parliament as Liberal candidate for Croydon at the 1909 Croydon by-election. In a three-way contest he finished second.\n\n\n== Military ==\nIn World War I Raphael served with the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a Lieutenant and died of wounds in 1917 at the Battle of Messines, while fighting in the country of his birth.He is buried at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery near Poperinge, West Flanders, Belgium.  Mrs Harriette Raphael, his mother, had her ashes buried next to his grave in 1929. A memorial to Raphael was erected by his mother at St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb\n, to whom she bequeathed the family home on her death.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of international rugby union players killed in action during the First World War\nList of select Jewish cricketers\nList of select Jewish rugby union players\n\n\n== References ==\nEncyclopedia Judaica, Second Edition, volume 19, p146"

        "article": "Shane Warne: The Musical is a musical comedy by Eddie Perfect based on the life of Australian cricketer Shane Warne. The Daily Telegraph described the musical as \"a warts-and-all account of the spin bowler's controversy-laden career and roller-coaster personal life set to soul, rock, opera, gospel music \u2013 and even a bit of Bollywood.\"\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe musical consists of two acts: the first act covering Warne's aborted Australian rules football career, his marriage and his rise to success as a Test cricketer while the controversial issues that Warne was involved in; such as his drug offence, infidelity and the John the bookmaker controversy feature in the second act. The musical finishes with a chorus \"Everyone's a little bit like Shane\".The musical contains a series of songs about various incidents in Warne's life both on and off the cricket field, including:\n\n\"The Tale Of Warne\";\n\"Run\";\n\"Get Offa The Couch\";\n\"How do you spell success? AIS\";\n\"We're Going There\";\n\"Piss It All Away\";\n\"Hollywood\";\n\"The Ball\";\n\"Payin' Attention Now\";\n\"Dancing with the Stars\";\n\"We Never Cross The Line\";\n\"The Away Game\";\n\"Is The Sun The Moon?\";\n\"I'm Coming Home\";\n\"Shine Like Shane\";\n\"What About That, Shane?\";\n\"The Ashes\";\n\"Bunny in the headlights\" (about Daryll Cullinan); and\n\"What an SMS I\u2019m in\".\n\n\n== Development ==\nAfter five years of solo cabaret shows, Perfect had wanted to write a full-scale musical.  Seeking a subject, Perfect reflected that: \"with every headline I read about Warnie, came the realisation that here was a simple yet complicated, positive yet flawed, honest but naive, charming, philandering, freakishly talented and endlessly divisive man. And that, I thought, is a great character.\"The Adelaide Cabaret Festival presented a work-in-progress showing on 17 June 2007 at the Dunstan Playhouse, Adelaide Festival Centre.  The 2008 Melbourne International Comedy Festival included a further showing at the Hi Fi Bar and Ballroom.\n\n\n== Productions ==\nThe full Australian production, directed by Neil Armfield with choreography by Gideon Obarzanek and with Perfect in the title role, opened at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne on 10 December 2008.  It toured to the Regal Theatre in Perth from 18 March 2009 and the Enmore Theatre in Sydney from 15 May 2009.\nA 2013 revision included a new beginning and ending, new scenes and a revised structure, four new songs and new characters including Liz Hurley.  It played short seasons in June for the Adelaide Cabaret Festival at Her Majesty's Theatre, then at Hamer Hall in Melbourne.  This production, directed by Simon Phillips, had a cast that included Perfect, Lisa McCune, Shane Jacobson and Christie Whelan-Browne.A cast album was recorded during the season at Hamer Hall and released in 2014.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nWhile initially suspicious of the project, Warne later gave his approval after watching the show, saying \"I think Eddie and his team have written the musical in a respectful and sympathetic way, and that they have captured my fun, larrikin side.\"The musical has been able to draw an audience that would not normally attend musicals with Perfect saying \"You see young blokes making their way to their seats carrying armfuls of beers for their mates, just like they do at the cricket. It's like Reformation theatre when people were buying oranges to throw at the actors \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t they have fun.\"Reviews for the musical have been mainly positive.\n\nHerald Sun: \"[The musical] is a wild, funny, outrageous, and by the end, surprisingly moving account of the champion spin bowler's life so far. [...] Among the fun, there's genuine respect for [Warne's] enormous talent but it doesn't gloss over his personal failings.\"\nThe Independent \"The mid-field marriage of a likeable star, fake bowling, plenty of sporting puns, and a moderate raunch factor had the crowds chuckling and clapping along. [...] [The musical makes] his life an appealingly debauched song and dance, playing with musical styles from nicely-harmonized gospel to gangsta rap.\"\nAustralian Stage: \"The story is thin, the songs are wordy and the sound wasn\u2019t great, so many of the lyrics were lost. [...] Without wanting to cut down a tall poppy, there are certainly holes in the script and score. But who cares!? The performances by the ensemble cast are brilliant, the packed audience loved it, the upfront this-is-what-I-am-and-who-gives-a-shit-what-you-think-about-me attitude (reflecting Shane's own character) is refreshing, the show will bring in thousands of audience-goers who love sport and Shane, but rarely go to the theatre (which is fantastic), so what more can a new Australian musical do?\"\nGideon Haigh, The Guardian: \"Perfect's vision is an almost unimprovable mingling of satire and homage, cheek and deference, music and comedy.\"\n\n\n== Awards and Nominations ==\n2008 Green Room Awards\nBest New Australian Musical (winner)\nMale Artist in a Leading Role \u2013 Eddie Perfect (nominated)\nFemale Artist in a Featured Role \u2013 Rosemarie Harris (nominated)\nFeatured Ensemble Performance \u2013 The Ensemble (nominated)\n2009 Helpmann AwardsBest New Australian Work \u2013 Eddie Perfect (winner)\nBest Musical (nominated)\nBest Choreography in a Musical \u2013 Gideon Obarzanek (nominated)\nBest Male Actor in a Musical \u2013 Eddie Perfect (nominated)\n2009 Victorian Premier's Literary AwardPrize for Musical Theatre Script (winner)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShane Warne: The Musical - David Spicer Productions (performance rights)"

        "article": "Mohammad Shahzad Mohammadi (Pashto: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u0647\u0632\u0627\u062f \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u064a\u200e; born 31 January 1988) is an Afghan cricketer. He a right-handed opening batsman who also plays as a wicketkeeper. He made his international debut for Afghanistan in August 2009.Shahzad was one of the eleven cricketers to play in Afghanistan's first ever Test match, against India, in June 2018. Shahzad also has a rare record - scoring an ODI hundred in a lowest team score - by reaching an ODI century at a point when Afghanistan's score (against India in the Asia Cup 2018) was just 131, thus equalling Pakistan's Shahid Afridi's previous record.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nShahzad's paternal family was originally from Nangrahar Province in Afghanistan, but they moved to a refugee camp in Peshawar, Pakistan. His maternal family are Punjabi Hindkos from Pakistan. Shahzad spent most of his early life in Peshawar and was married in Peshawar. He was still living in Peshawar as a temporary resident in 2018, prompting the Afghanistan Cricket Board to request he relocate to Afghanistan.\n\n\n== International cricket ==\nShahzad was not part of Afghanistan's squad when they began to rise through international cricket tournaments in 2008, joining for the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. His strong performances in the tournament helped Afghanistan obtain One Day International status and he has been a regular part of their national team in all three formats of the game since then.\n\n\n=== First-class cricket ===\n\n\n==== 2009\u20132010 ====\nShahzad first played first-class cricket for Afghanistan in the 2009\u201310 ICC Intercontinental Cup, the highest level of international cricket below Test cricket.\nIn August 2009, Shahzad made his first-class debut against a Zimbabwe XI at Mutare Sports Club, scoring 79 in his first ever first-class innings. He played a key role in Afghanistan's win over Ireland, with scores of 88 and 42 not out, and in February 2010, he became the first Afghan to score a first-class double century when he scored 214 not out in Afghanistan's successful chase of 494 runs to beat Canada. His other century for the tournament came in August 2010 against Scotland. He scored 54 in the first innings as Afghanistan put on 435 runs, then scored rapidly in the second innings as Afghanistan asserted their dominance on the game. Afghanistan did not declare until Shahzad reached his century, and he did so by hitting Moneeb Iqbal for six runs.Shahzad scored a half-century in the Intercontinental Cup final against Scotland to give Afghanistan the title in their first year of participation. He finished the tournament as the top run-scorer for both Afghanistan and the whole competition, with 802 runs at an average of 80.20, including two centuries and five half-centuries. He was also the leading wicket-keeper, with 28 dismissals behind the wickets, including 25 catches and 3 stumpings. As a result, he was one of four players from Afghanistan named in the team of the tournament.\n\n\n==== 2011\u20132017 ====\nShahzad scored a half-century in Afghanistan's opening match of the 2011\u201313 ICC Intercontinental Cup against Canada, but otherwise failed to have a major impact on the tournament. He never again scored above 50 and finished with an average of just 23.81, though at the end of the tournament, he was named the team's new vice-captain. In January 2012, Shahzad played in a side made up of some of the leading players from Associate and Affiliate teams called the ICC Combined Associate and Affiliate XI, which was put together to face England in Dubai. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Along with Mohammad Nabi and Hameed Hasan, Shahzad was one of three Afghanistan players included in the 12-man squad. During the match, he scored two half-centuries, and he was named the player of the match despite his team losing.Shahzad bounced back in the 2015\u201317 ICC Intercontinental Cup and scored his third and fourth first-class centuries against Papua New Guinea and Namibia respectively. The century against Papua New Guinea saw Afghanistan overcome a 151-run first innings deficit to win by 201 runs, and the century against Namibia, for which Shahzad was named the player of the match, helped Afghanistan to an innings victory. This was Afghanistan's final involvement in the Intercontinental Cup, as in 2017, they were granted full member status by the International Cricket Council and were automatically given Test status.\n\n\n=== Test cricket ===\nIn May 2018, Shahzad was named in Afghanistan's squad for their inaugural Test match played against India. He made his Test debut for Afghanistan, against India, on 14 June 2018. In February 2019, he was named in Afghanistan's Test squad for their one-off match against Ireland in India.\n\n\n=== One-day cricket ===\nShahzad played in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifiers, where Afghanistan gained ODI status after a win over Namibia in which Shahzad scored a decisive 73 runs.Shahzad made his ODI debut during Afghanistan's tour to the Netherlands on 30 August 2009 at VRA Cricket Ground. In the second match of the series, he made Afghan cricketing history by becoming the first Afghan to score a century in a One Day International match, scoring 110 runs as Afghanistan won the match by 6 wickets.Shahzad was a member of Afghanistan's 2010 ACC Trophy Elite winning squad, which defeated Nepal in the final by 95 runs.\nIn July 2010, Shahzad was part of Afghanistan's team in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One tournament, and he scored two half-centuries (both against the Netherlands) to help Afghanistan finish 3rd in the tournament, and another century in the first ODI of the series.In August 2013, in a series against Namibia, Shahzad scored a century and a half-century in two wins.\n\n\n=== T20I cricket ===\nIn February 2010, Shahzad made his Twenty20 International debut against Ireland as part of a tri-series in the lead-up to the 2010 World Twenty20 Qualifier. Shahzad was then a key member of Afghanistan's squad for the World Twenty20 Qualifier, as he scored 65 in Afghanistan's successful run chase in the tournament final against Ireland. He was later named in Afghanistan's squad for the World Twenty20.In the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, Shahzad scored three half-centuries, including one in the tournament final against Ireland. Afghanistan lost the match but qualified for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 regardless. During the World Twenty20, he played in both of Afghanistan's matches against India and South Africa.\nIn a two-match Twenty20 series against Scotland in March 2013, Shahzad made scores of 55 and 46 and was named the player of the match in both games. Shahzad then played in both the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier and the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. He went into the World Twenty20 in poor form, making consecutive scores of 7, 22, 0, 22 and 0, but he broke this form slump in Afghanistan's match against Hong Kong, when he scored 68 runs from 53 balls in a seven-wicket win.Shahzad played two explosive innings in the 2015 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, making scores of 74 against the United Arab Emirates and 75 against Scotland. His innings against Scotland was part of Afghanistan's highest ever score to that point (210) and his partnership with Asghar Afghan reached 110 runs in 63 balls, the biggest partnership for Afghanistan in Twenty20 cricket. He reached his half-century from 26 balls and finished with 75 off of 36 balls.Shahzad was also named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2016 T20 World Cup by Cricinfo.\n\n\n=== 2019 Cricket World Cup and beyond ===\nIn April 2019, Shahzad was named in Afghanistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. However, on 6 June 2019, he was ruled out of the tournament due to a knee injury, and was replaced by Ikram Ali Khil. Later in an interview, Shahzad said that he had no health problem but despite, that he was removed from the World Cup matches by the Afghan cricket board. He also said that it does not seem that he will return to the team.In September 2021, he was named in Afghanistan's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.\n\n\n== Twenty20 franchise cricket ==\nIn September 2016, Shahzad was signed by the Rangpur Riders in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) ahead of the draft for the 2016 season. On his BPL debut for the Riders, he scored 80 runs not out in a big nine-wicket win. In a match against the Barisal Bulls, Shahzad broke the record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in a BPL match with five (two catches and three stumpings), but this record was equalled by Umar Akmal in a match against the Riders later in the season. Three stumpings is also the most stumpings by a wicket-keeper in a BPL match. During a match against the Rajshahi Kings, Shahzad made physical contact with Sabbir Rahman with his bat. He was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.1 of the BCB's Code of Conduct and was fined 30% of his match fee and suspended for two matches. Shahzad was Rangpur's leading run-scorer for the season with 350 runs from 11 matches and a strike-rate of 110. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Chittagong Vikings team, following the draft for the BPL's 2018\u201319 season.In September 2018, Shahzad was named in Paktia's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament. Before the tournament, Shahzad was approached by a match-fixer, requesting he underperform in the tournament. He was the leading run-scorer in the tournament, with 344 runs in nine matches at a strike-rate of 174.61.\n\n\n== Domestic cricket ==\nDue to spending time with Afghanistan's national team, Shahzad has not played much top-level domestic cricket in Afghanistan. He has only played two matches in the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament, both in the 2015\u201316 season, before the tournament gained first-class status. He played for the Band-e-Amir Dragons, captaining the team in his first match. He also captained the Spin Ghar Tigers in the 2018 Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Tournament. He scored two centuries in the tournament and was named the player of the match on both occasions, and he helped Spin Ghar reach the final, where they lost to the Boost Defenders.Shahzad played in the first three seasons of the Shpageeza Cricket League, Afghanistan's national Twenty20 competition, from 2014 to 2016. In 2014, he played for the Boost Defenders, but he then changed teams to the Kabul Eagles, who won the 2016 edition of the tournament. Shahzad scored 90 runs in the 2016 tournament final and was named the player of the match.Shahzad has also played domestic cricket in Pakistan. In the 2010\u201311 season, he played three matches for Port Qasim Authority in Grade II of the PCB Patron's Trophy, and he played two matches as a wicket-keeper and opening batsman for Habib Bank Limited in the 2015\u201316 National One Day Cup, scoring 43 runs against Khan Research Laboratories and 15 runs against National Bank of Pakistan.\n\n\n== Records and statistics ==\nShahzad set the record for the most dismissals as a wicketkeeper in a single T20I innings (5) and also set the new record for becoming the first wicketkeeper from any team to involve in 5 dismissals in a T20I.\nDuring Zimbabwe tour in 2016, Shahzad scored the best innings of his cricketing career. With his magnificent century of 118 off 68, Shahzad has the most Twenty20 International Player of the Match awards by an affiliate member with 8 T20I Player of the Match awards. His score is currently the second highest T20I score by an associate player, after Hong Kong\u2019s Babar Hayat's 122 runs. Following this innings, his position in the ICC Player Rankings for T20I batsmen rose from 20th to 8th, his first time breaking into the top ten.\nOn 8 March 2016, Shahzad became the first associate player to score 10 fifty-plus scores in T20Is. With his 50 against Scotland in a group match of 2016 ICC World Twenty20, he achieved his 10th T20I score more than fifty. This is twice more than the next highest among players from associate teams (Stephan Myburgh & Paul Stirling has 5 fifty plus scores).\nAt the end of 2016, Shahzad was named the ICC's Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year.\nOn 20 January 2017, during Desert T20 Challenge, Shahzad, as the first cricket player in history, scored two half-centuries in two separate international matches on the same day (80 against Oman and 52* against Ireland).\nDuring the T20I series v Ireland, Shahzad became only the second player in T20I history to hit 200 fours after Tillakaratne Dilshan. He is in the third place for hitting most fours (200).\nShahzad hit the joint fastest half-century in T10 history when he reached his half century off 12 balls for Rajputs in 2018 T10 League.\n\n\n== Incidents and suspensions ==\nOn 7 April 2009, during the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, Shahzad was reprimanded by the ICC for showing dissent at an umpire's decision. After he was given out leg before wicket, Shahzad showed his bat to the umpire to indicate that he thought he had hit the ball. He was not suspended, but he was warned about his future behaviour.On 29 November 2016, during the 2016 Bangladesh Premier League, Shahzad was suspended by the Bangladesh Cricket Board for a physical altercation with Rajshahi Kings player Sabbir Rahman. During the fourth over of the second innings, while Shahzad was batting, Shahzad extended his bat as Rahman ran past. The incident came after the two players had been involved in a heated conversation in the first innings. Shahzad was found guilty of conduct contrary to the spirit of the game. He was suspended for two matches and fined 30% of his match fee.On 13 April 2017, Shahzad was charged by the ICC for violating the anti-doping code. After testing his sample on 17 January 2017 at ICCA Academy in Dubai, it was found to contain a prohibited substance, Clenbuterol. Therefore, he was provisionally suspended 12 days after issuing the notice of charges being laid on 26 April 2017. On 30 April 2017, ICC confirmed the provisional suspension of Shahzad. Shahzad decided not to challenge the provisional suspension and had to face disciplinary proceeding in accordance with the process set down in the ICC Anti-Doping Code. In December 2017, the ICC suspended Shahzad from all cricket for a period of twelve months, and he was eligible to resume playing from 17 January 2018.\nOn 8 March 2018, during the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, Shahzad was suspended by the ICC after being found guilty of causing damage to part of the ground during a match. After being dismissed, Shahzad slammed his bat into the pitch adjacent to the pitch being used and left a noticeable divet in the pitch. He was fined 15% of his match fee. As this was Shahzad's second violation of the ICC's code of conduct within a two-year period, (he had been fined the entirety of his match fee for an incident in a Twenty20 against the United Arab Emirates in December 2016) he was given a two-match suspension.In April 2018, Shahzad was fined and asked to relocate by the Afghanistan Cricket Board due to living in Peshawar, a city in Pakistan near its border with Afghanistan, and participating in a local club-level cricket competition. The ACB had introduced a strict policy on player residence, stating that players were not allowed to travel to other countries without permission, so Shahzad and other players were given one month to relocate to Afghanistan or risk having their contracts terminated. Additionally, by participating in a cricket competition without the ACB's permission, he had also violated the ACB's player code of conduct.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammad Shahzad at ESPNcricinfo"

Amir retired from international cricket in December 2020. Although on 14 June 2021, he stated that he is ready to return to the national team.Amir made his first-class debut in November 2008, and his first One-Day International and Test appearances in July 2009 in Sri Lanka at the age of 17. He played his first international match during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, where he played in every game, helping the national side win the tournament.On 29 August 2010, he was arrested for spot-fixing and was given a five-year ban for bowling two deliberate no-balls. Amir pleaded guilty on the verdict handed out by his prosecutor the International Cricket Council, and publicly asked for forgiveness. In November 2011, Amir was convicted at  Southwark Crown Court, along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif, of conspiracy charges relating to spot-fixing and spent 3 months in prison. He was given a five-year ban which was considered lenient, due to his juvenile age and confession, as compared to the other two conspirators who were given 7 and 10 years' suspensions, effectively ending their careers.On 29 January 2015, it was announced that Amir would be allowed an early return to domestic cricket despite his original ban being due to expire on 2 September 2015. Mohammad Amir signed with Chittagong Vikings to play the BPLT20-2015. He has since returned to play for Pakistan on their tour of New Zealand in 2016.In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018\u201319 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). On 26 July 2019, he announced his retirement from Test cricket in order to focus on limited overs cricket. On 17 December 2020, he announced his retirement from international cricket.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAmir was born in 1992 in Changa Bangial, Gujar Khan, Punjab, Pakistan. He is the son of Raja Muhammad Fayyaz. He was the second youngest of seven children. \"Wasim Akram is my favourite, he's my idol. When I used to watch him on TV, I would try to see what exactly he was doing with the ball. Then I would go outside and imitate his actions and bowling.\"In 2003, at the age of 11, Amir was spotted at a local tournament and invited to join the sports academy set up by Sir Asif Bajwa, who is the chairman of Bajwa Cricket Academy,  in Rawalpindi.After joining the national team, Amir moved to Lahore with his family to be closer to top-flight cricket facilities.Amir married British citizen Narjis Khan in September 2016. Together they have two daughters, Minsa Amir and Zoya Amir.\n\n\n== Domestic and T20 career ==\nAmir was first selected as a fast bowler by the former Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram at a fast bowling camp in 2007. Amir, then 15 years old, went on a tour of England with the Pakistan U-19 cricket team and was one of the leading bowlers. He took 8 wickets at an average of 16.37. In 2008, he took 4 wickets in successive matches against Sri Lanka and England. In this tri-nation tournament played in Sri Lanka he again excelled with his speed and swing bowling taking 9 wickets at average of 11.22 in three matches. Due to injury he played only a limited part in the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia.In March 2008, he made his domestic debut for the Rawalpindi Rams whilst concurrently representing the National Bank of Pakistan. His debut domestic season resulted in him taking 55 first-class wickets for NBP. He took a lot of top order wickets including those of players in the national side. This strong domestic form resulted in him making his international breakthrough in the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup.\nIn July 2019, he was selected to play for the Dublin Chiefs in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, the following month the tournament was cancelled. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Khulna Tigers in the 2019\u201320 Bangladesh Premier League. In October 2020, he was drafted by the Galle Gladiators for the inaugural edition of the Lanka Premier League.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== Debut years ===\nAmir made his international debut against England in the group stages of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. He took the wicket of Ravi Bopara with only his second ball, with Shoaib Malik taking a fine catch, and conceded only one run in his debut international over. Amir made his One Day International match debut against Sri Lanka taking 3 wickets at an economy rate of 4.50 and also scoring 23 runs.\nAfter his successful 2009 T20 World Cup tournament, Amir was selected in the test squad for Pakistan for the series in Sri Lanka. He was chosen alongside fast bowler Umar Gul and Abdur Rauf, ahead of more notable and experienced names such as Sohail Tanvir. He started his Test career well, taking six wickets in the match, which included the wicket of Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara in both innings, as well as the Sri Lankan batsman, Mahela Jayawardene's wicket in the 2nd innings. However he did not get any wickets in his next two Test matches. His next test wickets came in New Zealand where he managed to take four wickets in the first Test match, during a losing game. He won his first Test match with the Pakistan team during his 5th Test match, as Pakistan won comprehensively by 141 runs, he managed to take three wickets in the match including the wicket of Taylor, who scored 97 runs in the second innings. He shone brightly with the bat as well and showed a solid technique for a lower order batsman.\n\n\n=== World Twenty20 championships ===\nAmir continued to impress as the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 tournament continued, taking a wicket in his opening spell in 6 of the 7 games he played, including the final. He was particularly effective at using the short ball, with his skiddy bouncers rushing onto the batsmen, often causing them to mishit the ball for a catch. Amir consistently clocked speeds of above 145 kilometres per hour (90 miles per hour) and bowled his quickest delivery in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 final against Sri Lanka, at 152 kilometres per hour (94.4 miles per hour). His most important moment arguably came in the opening over of the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup final against Sri Lanka. He bowled with speed and with consecutive short deliveries to the tournament's top scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan obtained his wicket on the fifth delivery and managed to end the over with a wicket maiden.\nIn the initial stages of the 2010 World Cup Amir took three wickets in a five wicket-maiden over in a Twenty20 International match against  Australia. The other two men were run out in the same over. This set a world record of three wickets for a bowler in Twenty20 and 5 wickets for a team in one over.\n\n\n=== Pakistan Cricket Board contract ===\nAmir was ignored by Pakistan Cricket Board when they awarded cricket contracts to Abdul Razzaq and Mohammad Yousuf, even after his exceptional performance in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. Later on the Pakistan Cricket Board awarded Amir a 'C' category contract.\n\n\n=== Making a mark in the international arena ===\n\nOn 9 November 2009 he scored 73 runs against New Zealand which was a record for a number 10 batsman in ODI history until Ravi Rampaul surpassed that record with scoring 86* when batting at number 10 position in 2011. In that innings, with his batting partner Saeed Ajmal, Amir added 103 runs to Pakistan's chase, only to fall short by 7 runs.He impressed the Pakistan cricket team, including Wasim Akram, who took credit for discovering Amir, although Akram later commented that Amir needed to gain more weight to aid his development.Later in 2009, Pakistan toured Sri Lanka and in the first One Day International match, he shared a 62 run partnership with fast bowler Umar Gul for the tenth wicket but Pakistan lost by 36 runs. He also played a game against New Zealand in 2009\u20132010. During a match in the third One Day International match, when Pakistan were reduced to 8 wickets for 86 runs, he scored 73 runs not out, making the highest score by a number 10 batsman in One Day International cricket and putting on a 103 runs, 10th wicket partnership with Saeed Ajmal. He was unable to get his side to their victory target of 212 runs, as Ajmal was declare out in the last over and Pakistan lost by just 7 runs.During the Test match series against Australia in 2010, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took his first five wicket haul, taking the wickets of Australian batsmen Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey and Michael Clarke. On 24 July 2010 he was influential in helping Pakistan win the 2nd Test match against Australia; the first Test match Pakistan had won against them in 15 years, which also drew the series 1\u20131. During this match he took 7 wickets overall, and was declared man of the match. Overall, in the second series, he was the leading wicket taker of both teams with his 11 scalps.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Amir was awarded the man of the match award for becoming the youngest player to ever take a five-wicket haul in England. He also became the youngest player to take 50 test wickets earning praise from several former international cricketers. In that eventful series against England, he took 19 wickets, the highest of the Pakistanis and third highest overall at an outstanding average of 18.3. He also took 2 five-wicket hauls.\n\n\n=== International comeback ===\nAfter five years, on 13 March 2015, Amir made his domestic comeback playing for Omar Associates in the grade II patron's trophy. He took a wicket in his first comeback over.On 19 August 2015, Mohammad Amir was declared completely free to play all forms of cricket from 2 September 2015. On 15 January 2016, he made his return to international cricket in a T20I match against New Zealand. In February 2016, Amir took a hat-trick in a Pakistan Super League match for Karachi Kings. He also participated to the first T20I edition of Asia Cup in 2016 and also for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He later made his international comeback against England, where he was taunted by English fans chanting \"No Ball!\" at him.On 30 August 2016, against England at Nottingham Amir scored 58 after coming at no.11 and became the first cricketer to score a half century in ODIs after coming last in the batting order. He was dropped for the next match against England two days later.He along with Sarfraz Ahmed set the record for the highest 8th wicket partnership in ICC Champions Trophy history(75*)\n\n\n=== 2016 Asia Cup ===\nFollowing his return to international cricket, Amir participated in 2016 Asia Cup .In the fourth match of the tournament, Amir produced one of his best spells against arch rivals India. Batting first Pakistan were bowled out for 83 . Amir took 2 wickets in the first over itself, thus pushing the Indian team under pressure. However, as the target was low, India  chased the target with 4 overs to spare, Amir finished with 3/18 in that match. He continued his fine performance throughout the tournament and finished with 7 wickets with an economy under 6.\n\n\n=== 2017 ICC Champions Trophy ===\nAmir played his second ICC ODI tournament in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. During the first two games against arch rivals India and South Africa, Amir failed to pick up wickets but was economical with the figures of 0/32 (8.1) and 0/50 (10) respectively. It was Sri Lanka game where he picked up his first wickets. He picked important wickets of Angelo Mathews and Niroshan Dickwella and ended with figures of 2/53 (10). But his important contribution came from bat where he scored 28 from 63. Chasing Sri Lanka's target of 237, Pakistan were struggling at 162/7 before he arrived and, along with skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, shared an unbeaten stand of 75 to guide his team to their fourth semi final of their Champions Trophy.\nAmir missed the semi final against England due to back spasms. But his absence was barely noticeable as his replacement, Rumman Raees bowled well on debut with 2/44. Pakistan won that match by 8 wickets.\nAmir was pivotal in helping Pakistan win the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy by claiming top three wickets against arch-rivals India in the Final. Amir entered his second ICC final. It was against India, who were in a comfortable position. After Pakistan posted a challenging total of 338, it was the Indian batsmen that needed to be taken care of. Their top three batsmen, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli scored 70% of India's runs in the tournament. Amir got them all out. He trapped Sharma in front for LBW where he was given a three ball duck. Then he took the Indian skipper for 5. Kohli, at first, was dropped by Azhar Ali at first slip. However, he didn't have to wait much to take the wicket, making him edge the next ball to point where Shadab Khan took a good catch. Amir got his third after he bowled a cross seamer to Dhawan, which he edged to the wicket-keeper, Sarfaraz Ahmed for 21. Amir finished with the figures of 3/16 (6). It was Amir's dream spell as his side bowled out the defending champions for 158, winning by 180 runs.\nAmir has rated Indian cricketer Virat Kohli as the best batsman in the world. Kohli also rated Amir as one of the \u2018toughest\u2019 bowlers to face in the world cricket. Amir's brother said that this was what he wanted to do. After that spot fixing scandal at same city, he wanted to make up for his wrongdoings and the spell in the final was something that brought his family relief.\n\n\n=== 2018 Asia Cup ===\nAmir's performance in the Asia Cup was mediocre. During the 3 games Amir played, he was unable to pick up a single wicket. Hence, for the last match he was dropped. In his final Asia Cup game against India, Amir was trounced for 41 runs in his 5 overs without picking up a single wicket. His performance was criticised by both his countrymen and the cricketing world.\n\n\n=== 2019 Cricket World Cup ===\nIn May 2019, he was named in Pakistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named their final fifteen-man squad for the tournament. On 12 June 2019, in the match against Australia, Amir took his first five-wicket haul in ODIs. He finished the tournament as the leading wicket-taker for Pakistan, with 17 dismissals in eight matches.\n\n\n=== Retirement from Test cricket ===\nMohammad Amir announced his retirement from Test Cricket in July 2019. He finished his test career with an average of 30.47 and taking 119 wickets. He played a total of 36 tests since his debut in 2009.\n\n\n=== International Retirement ===\nAlleging ill-treatment from the Pakistan Cricket Board, Amir announced on 17 December 2020 that he will not be available for selection in international cricket anymore. He had cited \u2018mental torture\u2019 by the management as the reason behind his decision and he openly criticised Pakistan team management and coaching staff including Waqar Younis and Misbah-ul-Haq on more than one occasion. He also said that they have tried to spoil his image and it takes a lot of hard work to build your image.Although Waqar Younis denied it and said he was hurt by comments of Muhammad Amir.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\n\n=== Spot fixing allegation ===\n\nIn August 2010, the English newspaper News of the World published allegations that Amir and fellow bowler Mohammad Asif deliberately bowled no-balls during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England in return for payment from a betting syndicate.The News of the World alleged that an agent affiliated with some of the Pakistani players, later identified as Mazhar Majeed, had accepted a \u00a3150,000 (US$232,665) bribe from undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood for information that Amir and Asif would deliberately deliver no-balls at specific points during the match, information which could be used by gamblers to make wagers with inside information (a process known as spot-fixing, compared with match fixing to predetermine a match result).In the video posted by News of the World, Majeed, counting out the bribe money, promised that Amir would be Pakistan's bowler for the first over, and that the third ball of the over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the first over, and on his third delivery from the over, bowled a no-ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as a \"massive overstep\", a good half-metre beyond the popping crease. Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and the ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery.\nAs a result of the allegations and video posted by News of the World, Scotland Yard announced during the evening that they had arrested Majeed on charges of suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers.The allegations also affected the Mohammad Amir brand as the official Pakistani kit supplier BoomBoom Cricket announced that they had temporarily suspended their ties with Amir until further details on the allegations had emerged. BoomBoom stated that they will \"make a complete decision once his [Amir] fate had been decided by the authorities\"The Pakistani selector Yawar Saeed announced that Amir and the two other accused Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif had withdrawn from the Pakistani tour of England due to the mental torture suffered by the allegations. Amir also continued to protest his innocence in the allegations.\n\n\n=== Suspension, tribunal and ban ===\nOn 2 September 2010, after the warm-up List A game between Pakistan and Somerset, the International Cricket Council announced that they had suspended Amir under the provisions of the ICC's Anti-Corruption Code. The statement from the ICC stated that the three players (Asif, Amir and Salman Butt) were charged \"under various offences under Article 2 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to alleged irregular behaviour during, and in relation to, the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at Lord's last month\".Amir has got the sympathy of several ex-cricketers, including that of former England captain Michael Atherton. In an article for the News of the World, Atherton asserted that Amir is an asset to the game and must not be given a harsh punishment, considering his immense talent and young age. Atherton, now a journalist and broadcaster, recalled how Nasser Hussain, also an ex-England skipper, had summed up the mood at Lord's the previous Sunday:\n\"Nasser Hussain, who I once saw walking around the team hotel in Sri Lanka in the early hours of the morning before a Test match unable to sleep, so worried was he about his form, spoke for us all when he said, 'Please don't let it be the kid'.\"\nAtherton added: \"The 'kid' in question was Mohammad Aamer, the young, good-looking and prodigiously-talented Pakistan bowler who had blown England away on the second morning at Lord's with a mesmeric spell of left-arm bowling and who now, we had been told, had overstepped the front line twice for a few dollars more.\"Former South Africa bowler Henry Williams has called for Mohammad Amir to be treated with compassion if found guilty of spot fixing.The ICC announced that Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt had filed appeals to their ICC. suspensions and set their hearing on 30 and 31 October 2010 in Qatar. The Pakistan Interior Ministry also gave the three players their passports back so that they could travel to the hearing being held in QatarThe Pakistan Cricket Board barred Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt from using the National Cricket Academy in Gaddafi Stadium. They have been barred until their names have been cleared of Spot-fixing  The board said that Butt had used the facilities before the notices were sent and Asif and Amir haven't used them.\nAmir and Butt's appeals were heard by the ICC on 30 and 31 October 2010. They were however rejected and the players remain provisionally suspended. The case does not decide whether Amir is guilty but only if his suspension should be lifted. Both Butt and Amir hit out at the ICC stating they hadn't been given any evidence as to why their suspensions were rejected. Because the players couldn't participate in international cricket all three had their contracts also provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket BoardMohammad Amir stated that he was desperate to return to international cricket. He stated that he had been keeping his fitness levels high and that he had been participating in club cricket.Reports also emerged by Geo News that stated that Scotland Yard might call Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt back into the UK to complete the spot-fixing investigation Amir's teammate Butt who was also implicated in the Spot-fixing scandal announced that he wanted a delay in his hearing because he wanted the Scotland Yard investigation to be completed first. However Amir and Asif announced they were to go ahead with their trials as planned because they wanted a decision to be reached quickly so that they could be selected for the World Cup squad.Amir, Butt, and Asif had a tribunal in front of a three-man panel of members of the ICC from 6\u201311 January 2011. Amir's lawyers requested that the tribunal not announce its findings at the conclusion of the tribunal, wanting the tribunal to have the time necessary to fully review the evidence. The tribunal announced at its conclusion that they would announce their findings and any possible restrictions about a month later (the fifth of February 2011). The tribunal did announce that while additional charges against Salman Butt were filed over statements Majeed had made about the Third Test, that Amir and Asif would not face any charges over that test.On 5 February 2011, the ICC tribunal handed Amir a five-year ban, his teammate Mohammad Asif was handed a seven-year ban and Salman Butt was given a 10-year ban from participating in any cricketing related activities which are governed by the ICC or any of its members. Shortly after the decision Amir announced his intent to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration Amir also stated that he hoped to return to International Cricket soon, stating he had \"received confidence and support from Pakistani fans supporting him outside the Qatar Financial Centre\". Some former players around the world such as Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff & Ian Healy called for Amir to be banned for life.\nOn 15 September 2011 Amir has reportedly admitted to his involvement in last year's spot-fixing scandal before a court in England.\n\n\n=== Breach of ban ===\nOn 4 June 2011, Amir played an innings of cricket for Addington 1743 Cricket Club in a Surrey Cricket League match against St Luke's Cricket Club in breach of Article 6.5 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code. Amir stated that he made enquiries in respect of the status of the match, and was informed that it was a friendly match and playing would not be in contravention of his ban. Addington 1743 claimed that they had asked whether or not Amir could play for them, and were told that he could. As of 10 June 2011, the ICC were investigating the incident.\n\n\n=== Criminal conviction ===\nOn 1 November 2011, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif were convicted at Southwark Crown Court, along with Amir who had previously pleaded guilty, of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. He was sentenced to 6 months in Feltham Young Offenders Institution on 3 November, whilst Butt and Asif were sentenced to 30 months and 12 months in prison respectively. Mazhar Majeed was sentenced to two years and eight months.  Amir, along with Butt, appealed against the length of their sentences, however this was dismissed by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice on 23 November.  Amir was later transferred to Portland Young Offenders Institute in Dorset, from which he was released on 1 February 2012, having served half of his six-month sentence.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for match fixing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohammad Amir at ESPNcricinfo\nMohammad Amir at Yahoo!

Previously, he played domestic cricket for Karachi Zebras, making his debut with them in the 2008\u201309 season.\nAfter some notable limited overs performances opening the batting for Karachi Zebras (250 runs in seven games at a strike rate of 96.11), Hasan was one of two uncapped players in the Pakistan squad for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. In February 2018, he was banned for one year, extended to four years after an appeal, for his part in the 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter poor performances by Salman Butt at the start of the tournament, he made his Twenty20 international debut on 13 June 2009 against New Zealand scoring 35 off 28 balls hitting 4 fours and 2 sixes. He maintained his place in the side, scoring 19 runs in the final against Sri Lanka as Pakistan went on to win the 2009 ICC World Twenty20.\nAfter his performance in the Twenty20 he gained a lot of weight and wasn't chosen for touring in any formats of the game, however he was named in the 2010 Asia Cup squad along with many surprises such as Shoaib Akhtar, Asad Shafiq, Umar Amin and Abdur Rehman.

He also played for the Queensland Sheffield Shield team for seven years, captaining them 11 times in his 25 appearances.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nIn cricket, Levy was a prolific left-handed batsman who was a right-handed medium pace bowler; in baseball, he was a right-handed pitcher who also played shortstop. He played with the Waverley cricket and baseball clubs under coach and ex-international player Alan Kippax. Levyassisted Waverley to dominate the Sydney Baseball Premiership winning the competition from 1924 through to 1928 and represented New South Wales through these years. Through his success in baseball he became the first player to be offered a scholarship to play and study in the US. Although he declined this offer so he could continue his studies on insurance in Australia.\nIn 1928, Levy's insurance company moved him to an office in Brisbane where he went to play his sport with Valley. He dominated the competition as a pitcher and the following year he played with Eastern Suburbs alongside Gunnah Mollah where they dominated the competition until Mollah switched to Valley in 1930 as to even up the competition. During his time playing baseball in Queensland, he got selected in the Queensland cricket team in 1929 and made his debut against Victoria scoring 129 and playing as a wicket-keeper.\nIn 1932, Levy along with Roger Hartigan, persuaded Jack Hutcheon, president of Queensland Cricket, to call a meeting at Brisbane YMCA Hall for men interested in playing baseball and produced great interest among cricketers in the winter off-season. Levy was instrumental in the resurgence of baseball both in this era and after World War II. He was president of the organisation from 1936 to 1938 and was a player coach of the state team from 1933 to 1938 and again in 1954.\nLevy continued to have success over the next seven years of state cricket, including matches against a touring Marylebone Cricket Club averaging over 40 and was seriously considered for Australian selection, but was refused to travel inter-state with the Queensland team by his insurance company, effectively preventing him from participating in the 1939 Claxton Shield, the first Queensland participated in.\nAfter retiring from professional cricket, he went on to coach Queensland in interstate games, as well as a friendly series against the Tokyo Giants in 1954. Levy died in 1965 and was buried in Brisbane's Toowong Cemetery. He was of Jewish extraction, and has been called the \"first notable Jewish cricketer\" in Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHarris, J.O (2009).

        "article": "Malcolm Douglas Lyon (22 April 1898 \u2013 17 February 1964), generally known as Dar Lyon was an English first-class cricketer who played for Somerset County Cricket Club through the 1920s.  He was a right-handed top order batsman known for his beautiful driving who occasionally captained and kept wicket for the county.\nHe also became a politician, barrister, and later a magistrate, colonial administrator and judge in various British colonies.  He was Chief Justice of the Seychelles from 1948 to 1957.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nBorn in Caterham, Surrey, on 22 April 1898, Lyon was educated at Rugby School. He enjoyed a lot of success in school cricket, playing in the school XI for three years, and captaining the side in his final year. He finished his schooling in the middle of the First World War (1914\u20131918), and was called up for service in the British Army. He initially served in the ranks of the Royal Field Artillery, but was commissioned as an officer, with the rank of second lieutenant, on 20 February 1917. He was wounded in action during the war.After demobilisation in 1919, Lyon chose to continue his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. During his first year, he only played one first-class match for the university, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's, and failed to get a 'blue'. His first-class debut however, came earlier than this, when he turned out for Somerset against Cambridge University Cricket Club at the end of May 1920. In the following match, a County Championship tie against Worcestershire, Lyon scored his maiden first-class century, hitting 115 in 135 minutes.During his second year, Lyon got his 'blue', appearing in seven first-class matches for Cambridge University before keeping wicket for a strong Cambridge side during the University Match against Oxford University Cricket Club. In a reversal from the previous year, he also played for Cambridge University against his Somerset team-mates. He once again kept wicket for a victorious Cambridge side against Oxford the following year. While at Cambridge he was also a member of Footlights, and president from 1921 to 1923.\n\n\n== England prospect ==\nLyon was described in his Wisden obituary as being \"considered by many to be among the best batsmen who never gained a cap for England\". An amateur, he passed 1,000 runs in the 1923 season, and was selected to play for the Gentlemen in July of the same year. He scored 120 in the match, putting on 219 in a second wicket partnership with Greville Stevens. The following season, he was selected to play for 'The Rest' against England, in a three-day Test Trial match. Lyon recorded scores of 32 and 3, and took a catch in both innings during a three wicket loss. Lyon was the only member of the team not to go on to represent England at Test cricket. Fellow Somerset batsman Jack MacBryan wasn't impressed, saying of his friend, \"Dar is a grand chap and a very fine cricketer. Don't know what the Test selectors were thinking about.\" Later in the season, he hit his highest total in first-class cricket as he made 219 against Derbyshire. He once again represented the Gentlemen, but after scoring 11 in the first innings, was out for a duck in the second.Lyon only made six appearances in the County Championship during the 1925 season, the highlight being a century during the 93 run loss to Warwickshire. The following summer of 1926 was among the last in which Lyon played a significant number of games for Somerset, as he spent more and more time on his legal career, with his 20 appearances yielding 1062 runs. In a match against the touring Australians, Lyon showed the England selectors what they were missing out on.  He played Clarrie Grimmett with little regard for the wrist-spinner's reputation and struck 136 runs in an innings total of only 245 for Somerset. He finished the summer on a high with a further century coming in the final match against Yorkshire.Recognition did come in the form of a call-up for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in May 1927, with Lyon making a half-century against Surrey, followed by a century against the New Zealanders. Sporadic performances in the late 1920s and early 1930s were highlighted by centuries against Essex and Surrey. When he was appointed to Gambia in 1932, Lyon's first-class cricket career was all but ended.  A further appearance in 1935 against Middlesex resulted in a pair. He returned to Somerset in 1938, and played his final season for the county.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1923 Lyon took up farming in Suffolk. In 1925, he was called to the bar, practising on the South Eastern Circuit and in London.  He stood as Liberal party candidate for Bury St Edmunds at the 1929 general election, finishing second. He was appointed a magistrate in Gambia in 1932. On 9 June 1933 (now described as an acting legal adviser) he was appointed to both the Executive and Legislative Councils of Gambia as one of the official advisors of the governor. He was then appointed a resident magistrate in Tanganyika, where he served until 1938.With the outbreak of the Second World War (1939\u20131945), Lyon was again commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 28 December 1939. He served as a Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General at the War Office until 1941, when he was given command of a light anti-aircraft artillery regiment. After the war he moved to Kenya, where he was appointed a Resident Magistrate in 1945.  He next became Chief Justice of the Seychelles in 1948, serving until 1957 when he was appointed a puisne judge of the Ugandan High Court. In July 1954 a petition signed by a number of leading residents of the Seychelles, asking that Lyon not be appointed for a third term, and making various allegations about his conduct, was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lennox-Boyd in London.  Lennox-Boyd decided there was no case to answer, but the petition caused considerable debate in the House of Commons in July and August 1956. Lyon served in Uganda until 1961, when he retired to the United Kingdom.  He died at Hastings on 17 February 1964.  He had been married twice.  In addition to his cricketing and legal careers, he composed music for revues organised by Andr\u00e9 Charlot.\n\n\n== Family ==\nLyon's younger brother, Beverley Hamilton Lyon, known as Bev, played for Oxford University and Gloucestershire. The brothers were on opposing sides in the 1922 Varsity match. And in 1930, in the match between Somerset and Gloucestershire at Taunton, Dar scored 210 after being dropped twice by Tom Goddard, but Bev replied with a century of his own and led his side to victory by eight wickets.On 9 May 1928, Lyon married Helen Alice Earle (n\u00e9e Elliot), who had been divorced earlier that year by Lyon's Somerset cricket colleague Guy Earle, whose second wife she had been. Helen Lyon was born in 1899 and died in 1967. They had one daughter, named Elizabeth Helen Lyon.His family were of Jewish origin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of select Jewish cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFoot, David (1986).

        "article": "Kyle Malcolm Jarvis (born 16 February 1989) is a Zimbabwean former cricketer who represented Zimbabwe and played for Lancashire. The son of another former Zimbabwean international cricketer Malcolm Jarvis, he was educated at St John's College, Harare, where he excelled at rugby and cricket. Kyle was a key bowler for Zimbabwe in the 2008 Under-19 World Cup and he also played for the Zimbabwe U-19 Rugby Team. He was coached by Zimbabwean veteran seamer Heath Streak. He was one of the fastest bowlers to have played for Zimbabwe bowling at 140kph very often during his early career. On 17 June 2021, Jarvis retired from all forms of cricket after battling a trio of illnesses earlier this year.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJarvis was first called up to the Zimbabwe squad even before he had made his first-class debut, for the ODI series against the touring Kenyan team in 2009. He received his maiden national call up and was fast tracked into the national team after the appointment of Heath Streak as the then bowling coach for Zimbabwe as well as following a string of impressive performances with the ball during the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. The squad also marked a comeback for star wicketkeeper-batsman Tatenda Taibu in the national team. Jarvis was also picked for the Zimbabwe XI to play the Kenyans in the ICC Intercontinental Cup fixture and made his first-class debut in the same match. Jarvis made his ODI debut on 12 October 2009 against Kenya at Harare during the first ODI of the series. He took 3 wickets for just 36 runs. He eventually took 5 wickets on tour at an economy rate of 5.78.Following his performances on his maiden tour, Jarvis was picked for the tour to Bangladesh in 2009. The tour was not particularly good for Jarvis taking just five wickets from four matches, at a cost of 161 runs. An economy rate of 6.00 was only better than part-timer Malcolm Waller's 7.50; his bowling average of 32.20.Jarvis made his first-class debut in an ICC Intercontinental Cup fixture against Kenya played out at the Kwekwe Sports Club. Jarvis took 2 wickets on debut. He made his debut Logan Cup match for Mashonaland Eagles, taking match figures of 6/60.Jarvis made his Test cricket debut for Zimbabwe against Bangladesh at Harare on 4 August 2011. The match marked Zimbabwe's return to Test cricket after a six-year absence. He went on to play in Zimbabwe's one-off Tests against Pakistan and New Zealand later in 2011, taking a five-wicket haul (5\u201364) in the second innings of the New Zealand Test. He was part of the Zimbabwe squad which competed at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 which was held in Sri Lanka.After the New Zealand home series, Jarvis was included on the Zimbabwean tour to the West Indies in March 2013, where he bettered his 5 wickets for 64 runs against New Zealand with a new Test best of 5 for 54 in the first Test at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. He subsequently played in the ODI and T20 fixtures in that tour.\nJarvis was also picked in the April 2013 series against the touring Bangladeshis. He took nine wickets in the two match Test series, at an average of 33.33, with an innings best of 4\u201340 in the first Test at the Harare Sports Club. He also featured in the ODI series against Bangladesh, playing two out of the three matches but only managing to take three wickets at an average of 38.33. He did not play any of the subsequent T20 matches.\nOn 18 August 2013, Jarvis announced he had retired from international cricket to pursue a county contract with Lancashire in England as a non overseas player, at a time when there was a standoff between Zimbabwe players and the Zimbabwe Cricket regarding the payment structure prior to Zimbabwe's home series against Pakistan. He was reported to have signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire in late 2015. During his stint with Lancashire, he impressed with ball ending up as the top wicket taker for Lancashire with 62 wickets in the Division 2 of the 2015 County Championship and also ended up as the leading wicket taker for Lancashire with 51 scalps in the Division 1 of the 2016 County Championship and in his final year with Lancashire, he managed to pick 36 wickets at an average of 22.33. He was named as Lancashire club's player of the championship in 2015 for his breathtaking performance with the ball in the 2015 county season which also helped Lancashire club to be promoted from Division 2 to Division 1 of the County Championship.In September 2017, Jarvis left Lancashire, to return to Zimbabwe to play international cricket. He ended his stint with Lancashire prematurely although he was contracted to play for the county side until 2018. In October 2017, he was included in Zimbabwe's Test squad for series against West Indies. He made a brief cricket return and picked 1-40. Against Bangladesh in 2018 he took figures 5-71 and 2-27. In an interview with Cricinfo in 2018, he stated that Australian pacer Glenn McGrath was his childhood hero and revealed that he modelled his bowling action similar to McGrath. He also stated that he had relied on his slow bowling around 130kph in his later career because of not being consistent enough to deliver around 140kph as well as to manage the workload and injury concerns. He was also part of the Zimbabwean squad which played at the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier which was held in Zimbabwe.In January 2020, Jarvis was ruled out from the second test match against Sri Lanka after suffering a back injury and muscle spasms in the first test of the series. He underwent significant rehabilitation for months after suffering back injury in 2020. However, in February 2021 it was revealed that Jarvis had been diagnosed with trio of illness at the same time including COVID-19, malaria and tick bite fever which forced him to take a break from cricket for a period of six months and underwent medical treatment at the Borrowdale Trauma Centre in Harare. He was reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 in January 2021 after completing a training session. On 17 June 2021, in a press conference with Zimbabwe Cricket, he announced his retirement from international cricket at the age of 32 citing illness and fitness issues. He is set to pursue his career focusing on a new personal business venture including planning to build a restaurant and to carry on vehicle import export business following his retirement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kyle Jarvis at Wikimedia Commons\nKyle Jarvis at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "In the sport of cricket, a batsman is said to have scored a century when they reach a score of 100 or more runs in an innings without being dismissed. In first-class cricket, the highest form of the game below international level, a total of 25 players have achieved the feat on a hundred or more occasions. For statistical purposes, any centuries scored in a Test match are included as first-class centuries (as shown in the Table below).\nThe first cricketer to achieve the feat was W. G. Grace, who completed his hundredth century in May 1895. Grace remains the only batsman to have achieved the feat and finish with a batting average below 40.The English County Championship has historically always been the first-class competition in which the most matches are played per season, hence the most conducive competition to prolific run-scoring. Of the 25 men to have scored 100 first-class centuries, all have been either natively English or English-qualified except Donald Bradman of Australia, Zaheer Abbas of Pakistan, Glenn Turner of New Zealand and West Indian Viv Richards. Zaheer Abbas (Gloucestershire), Turner (Worcestershire) and Richards (Somerset) all had substantial county careers as overseas players; Bradman, the first non-English batsman to achieve the feat, therefore remains the only batsman to have done so despite never having played for an English county side.\n\n\n== Batsmen with 100 centuries or above ==\nNote: this list uses the figures accepted by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.

        "article": "David Wiese (born 18 May 1985) is a former South African cricketer who plays in franchise leagues. Wiese became eligible to play international cricket for Namibia due to his father having been born in Namibia.Previously, he represented his national side before ending his career in 2017. He has also made 67 first-class appearances since his debut in October 2005. He currently plays for Lahore Qalandars in PSL. He also played CPL , he is currently playing for  Saint Lucia Kings . His form since his breakthrough into first-class cricket saw him selected to play for South Africa in the 2009 Hong Kong Cricket Sixes, where he finished the leading wicket-taker, and for the South Africa Invitation XI in two matches against England. He is known for his explosive low order batting and ability to deliver slow ball.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWiese grew up in the eastern Mpumalanga Province. He spent his early years at Standerton, a town which is known for farming. He attended the high school in the coal mining hub of Witbank. He started playing cricket at the age of nine.He trained at a cricket institute owned by a South African coach Harry Shapiro. Wiese initially became fond of the art of spin bowling at the institute. However, he later pursued his interest in bowling pace as he grew older and taller with time. Although he was interested in pursuing his career in cricket, he was discouraged by his parents who urged him to focus more on studies. He was sent to University of Pretoria where he pursued his degree in internal auditing. He also occasionally played cricket for the university's third team during his first year with the University of Pretoria.\n\n\n== Rising through the ranks ==\nHe was included in the Titans squad for the 2012 Champions League Twenty20. During the semifinal of the 2012 CLT20 against Sydney Sixers, he hammered 61 runs off just 28 balls including six sixes which propelled Titans to a decent total of 163/5. His knock in the Champions League T20 semi final was widely appreciated and received social media attention despite Titans was knocked out of semi final. Following his knock, he was tipped to succeed veteran allrounder Jacques Kallis in the limited overs format and to fill in the void left by Lance Klusener. He was also subsequently included in the South African T20I squad for the tour of Sri Lanka in 2013 based on his batting prowess and also as an injury cover for Jacques Kallis.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nHe made an impact in his first domestic season both with the bat and ball playing for Easterns in the 2005\u201306 SAA Provincial Cup, scoring 526 runs at an average of 37.57 and taking 26 wickets at an average of 28.15 in nine first-class matches. He also received wide attention during the 2016\u201317 CSA T20 Challenge whereas few reports claimed that he delivered 173.8 kph in a match against the Knights. However, it was later revealed that the error had happened due to a technical glitch.He signed up with Sussex County Cricket Club for the 2016 T20 Blast as an overseas player before becoming a mainstay with the club after signing a three-year Kolpak deal in 2017.In August 2017, he was named in Benoni Zalmi's squad for the first season of the T20 Global League. However, in October 2017, Cricket South Africa initially postponed the tournament until November 2018, with it being cancelled soon after. He was part of the Tshwane Spartans which emerged as runners-up to Paarl Rocks in the 2019 Mzansi Super League.He left Sussex in 2020 after featuring in four county seasons for the club as his Kolpak registration expired following Britain's exit from the European Union. In November 2020, it was confirmed that he would stay with the Sussex side as an overseas player for the 2021 T20 Blast.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe made his T20I debut for South Africa against Sri Lanka on 2 August 2013. However, he was soon dropped from the national team and he was sent to play domestic cricket after modest returns in the three match T20I series against Sri Lanka. He made his One Day International debut for South Africa against New Zealand on 19 August 2015. He was included in the South African squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 where South Africa reached semifinals.On 9 January 2017, Wiese signed a Kolpak deal with Sussex which made him ineligible to represent South Africa anymore, ending his international career.In August 2021, head coach of the Namibian cricket team Pierre de Bruyn confirmed that Wiese would be available to represent Namibia at the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In September 2021, Wiese was named in Namibia's squad for the T20 World Cup tournament.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDavid Wiese at ESPNcricinfo\nDavid wiese IPL Profile from RoyalChallengers"

        "article": "In cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nHat-tricks are rare, and as such are treasured by bowlers.\nThe term is also sometimes used to mean winning the same competition three times in a row. For example, Australia winning the Cricket World Cup in 1999, 2003 and 2007, and Lancashire winning the County Championship in 1926, 1927 and 1928.\n\n\n== Test cricket ==\nIn Test cricket history there have been just 46 hat-tricks, the first achieved by Fred Spofforth for Australia against England in 1879. In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa. The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble, against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan's Wasim Akram, in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad in 2011 and 2014.\nNuwan Zoysa of Sri Lanka is the only bowler to achieve a hat-trick with his first three balls in a Test, against Zimbabwe in 1999. In 2006, Irfan Pathan of India achieved a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match against Pakistan.\nAustralian fast bowler Peter Siddle took a hat-trick in an Ashes test match against England on 25 November 2010, Siddle\u2019s 26th birthday. The event became a well-renowned part of Australian cricket culture, being known as \"Siddle\u2019s hat-trick on his birthday\", subsequently achieving cult status and being referred to by some as an internet meme.\n\n\n== One Day Internationals ==\nIn One Day International cricket there have been 49 hat-tricks, the first by Jalal-ud-Din for Pakistan against Australia in 1982, and the most recent player to achieve this feat is Kuldeep Yadav of India against West Indies in the 2019 Three match ODI series during the West Indies tour of India.\nSri Lanka's Lasith Malinga is the only bowler to take three hat-tricks in a single form of international cricket with his three in ODIs. Four players have taken at least two ODI hat-tricks in their careers: Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq of Pakistan, Chaminda Vaas of Sri Lanka and Kuldeep Yadav of India. (Akram therefore has four international hat-tricks in total).\nChaminda Vaas is the only player to achieve a hat-trick with the first three deliveries in a One Day International, against Bangladesh in the tenth match of 2003 ICC World Cup at City Oval, Pietermaritzburg. He also took a fourth wicket with the fifth ball of the same over, just missing the double-hat-trick.\n\n\n== Unusual hat-tricks ==\nSome hat-tricks are particularly extraordinary. On 2 December 1988, Merv Hughes, playing for Australia, dismissed Curtly Ambrose with the last ball of his penultimate over and Patrick Patterson with the first ball of his next over, wrapping up the West Indies first innings. When Hughes returned to bowl in the West Indies second innings, he trapped Gordon Greenidge lbw with his first ball, completing a hat-trick over two different innings and becoming the only player in Test cricket history to achieve the three wickets of a hat-trick in three different overs.\nIn 1844, underarm bowler William Clarke, playing for \"England\" against Kent, achieved a hat-trick spread over two innings, dismissing Kent batsman John Fagge twice within the hat-trick. Fagge batted at number 11 in the first innings and at number 3 in the second. This event is believed to be unique in first-class cricket.The most involved hat-trick was perhaps when Melbourne club cricketer Stephen Hickman, playing for Power House in March 2002, achieved a hat-trick spread over three overs, two days, two innings, involving the same batsman twice, and observed by the same non-striker, with the hat-trick ball being bowled from the opposite end to the first two. In the Mercantile Cricket Association C Grade semi-final at Fawkner Park, South Yarra, Gunbower United Cricket Club were 8 for 109 when Hickman came on to bowl his off spin. He took a wicket with the last ball of his third over and then bowled number 11 batsman Richard Higgins with the first ball of his next over to complete the Gunbower innings, leaving Chris Taylor the not out batsman. Power House scored 361, putting the game out of reach of Gunbower. In the second innings opener Taylor was joined by Higgins at the fall of the fourth wicket as Hickman returned to the attack. With his first ball, observed by an incredulous Taylor at the non-striker's end, he clean bowled Higgins, leaving Higgins with a pair of golden ducks.\n\n\n== More than three dismissals ==\nThe feat of taking four wickets in four balls has occurred only once in One Day International cricket, in the 2007 World Cup, when Lasith Malinga managed the feat against South Africa. Malinga then repeated this triumph in a T20I against New Zealand during their tour of Sri Lanka. It has also occurred on other occasions in first-class cricket. Kevan James of Hampshire took four wickets in four balls and scored a century in the same county game against India in 1996. The Cricinfo report on the game claimed that this was unique in cricket.Albert Trott and Joginder Rao are the only two bowlers credited with two hat-tricks in the same innings in first-class cricket.  One of Trott's two hat-tricks, for Middlesex against Somerset at Lords in 1907, was a four in four.\nFor Gloucestershire against Yorkshire in 1922, Charlie Parker had a hat-trick that was nearly five wickets in five balls: he actually struck the stumps with five successive deliveries, but the second was a no-ball.\nFive wickets in five balls was achieved by Scott Babot of Wainuiomata Cricket Club playing in the Senior 3 competition in New Zealand in 2008; it happened across two innings and separated by seven days, as the match took place on consecutive Saturdays.During Brazil's national T20 in 2017, the spectators witnessed a triple hat trick when Carioca Cricket Club's off spinner, Rafi ur Rahman claimed 5 wickets with 5 consecutive balls. The feat came against Brasilia Federal District when the unorthodox off spinner claimed a leg before, two players clean bowled and two caught. The moment was declared \"Best of the year\" in the 2017 national awards by the club.A 'perfect over' of 6 wickets taken with 6 consecutive balls was achieved by Australian Aled Carey on 21 January 2017 while bowling for Golden Point Cricket Club against East Ballarat Cricket Club in the Ballarat Cricket Association competition. This very rare feat consisted of 2 catches, an LBW and 3 bowled.Taking two wickets in two consecutive deliveries is occasionally known as a brace, or (more commonly, especially until the next delivery has been made) being on a hat-trick. In Australia, four wickets in four balls is sometimes referred to as a double hat-trick on the basis that there are two ways of compiling the three-in-three sequence (i.e. wickets 1,2 and 3 or wickets 2,3 and 4).\n\n\n== Three dismissals by fielders ==\nThere are very few cases of a fielder or wicket keeper taking a hat-trick of dismissals off consecutive deliveries in first-class cricket, and none in international cricket. The first such instance is the only known hat-trick of stumpings by a wicket keeper: WH Brain for Gloucestershire against Somerset in 1893, all off the bowling of CL Townsend. There has never been a first-class wicket-keeping hat-trick that mixes catches and stumpings, but four other wicket-keepers have taken a hat-trick of catches: KR Meherhomji for Railways vs Freelooters at Secunderabad (the only instance outside England) in 1931, GO Dawkes for Derbyshire vs Worcestershire at Kidderminster in 1958, RC Russell for Gloucestershire against Surrey at The Oval in 1986, and T Frost for Warwickshire against Surrey at Edgbaston in 2003. (In Russell and Frost's cases, no bowler took a hat-trick since their catches were taken off different bowlers in successive overs: Meherhomji's and Dawkes's feats were hat-tricks for the bowlers as well, L Ramji and HL Jackson.) There are only two recorded cases of a hat-trick of catches being recorded by a non-wicket-keeper, both of which were also hat-tricks for the bowler as well: GJ Thompson, for Northants against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 2014 (all off SG Smith), and Marcus Trescothick for Somerset against Notts in 2018 at Trent Bridge (all off Craig Overton). Trescothick - though more famous as a batsman and only an occasional bowler - has also taken a hat-trick as a bowler, in 1995 against the Young Australians.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Test cricket hat-tricks\nList of One Day International cricket hat-tricks\nList of Twenty20 International cricket hat-tricks\nList of first-class cricket records#Hat-tricks\nList of women's international cricket hat-tricks\nHat-trick\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "I Zingari are a wandering amateur cricket club. Founded on 4 July 1845 by three Old Harrovians, it is one of the oldest cricket clubs still in existence. The purpose of the club was to nurture amateur cricket following the rise of professionalism, which had resulted in most clubs and counties employing at least one professional player to strengthen their side. I Zingari sides were chosen carefully, and such was their strength in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a number of their matches were considered to be of first-class status.  I Zingari Australia played senior club cricket for a few seasons after their formation in 1888, before being excluded from Electorate cricket. They have not played any first-class cricket.I Zingari played numerous fixtures each season from 1845, primarily facing Eton College and Harrow School in the 1840s, and later playing more against stronger opposition; the Gentlemen of England and county sides became frequent opponents. In 1866 they took on the 'Gentlemen of the South' at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury. This match is the first of their fixtures to be considered of first-class status. I Zingari lost by 121 runs to the Gentlemen, whose team included W.G. Grace and two of his brothers. I Zingari's next first-class match came eleven years later, when they played Yorkshire County Cricket Club as part of the Scarborough Festival. They competed in the festival for each of the following thirteen seasons \u2013 with the exception of 1883 \u2013 and played Yorkshire on seven occasions, the 'Gentlemen of England' six times and the touring Australians twice. They played two further first-class fixtures, both against the 'Gentlemen of England' at Lord's Cricket Ground, in 1895 and 1904.In 17 first-class fixtures, 85 different cricketers appeared for I Zingari. Lancashire and England Test cricketer A. G. Steel appeared for the club on the most occasions, playing ten matches between 1879 and 1895. His 52 wickets are the most taken for the side by any player. Middlesex captain A. J. Webbe scored the most runs for I Zingari, accumulating 612 during his seven matches. He also scored more centuries for the amateur side than any other player, passing 100 on two occasions, while the highest score for I Zingari was 147, by Teddy Wynyard. Alfred Lyttelton, one of three Lyttelton brothers to play for the side, was the most successful wicket-keeper, claiming 17 dismissals.\nMany members of the upper classes played for the side throughout their first-class years. Among these were Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein, the only member of the British Royal Family to have played first-class cricket. Members of the peerage also played for I Zingari, including Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley, Beilby Lawley, 3rd Baron Wenlock, Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke and George Harris, 4th Baron Harris. At least three players were Members of Parliament, chief among them Alfred Lyttelton and Edward Stanhope who were both members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Cecil Wilson, who appeared for the side twice, also served as an Anglican Bishop of Melanesia and Bishop of Bunbury.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== Cricketers ==\n\n\n== References =="

He made his first-class debut for Hyderabad in the 2009\u201310 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy on 10 October 2009. He was banned for two and a half years in 2017 for his involvement in spot-fixing. In August 2019, his ban was lifted and became available for playing again. \nKnown as an attacking opening batsman, he was a member of the bronze-medal team at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for Pakistan on 8 December 2013 against Afghanistan and his One Day International (ODI) debut on 18 December 2013 against Sri Lanka. In his debut ODI match he scored 61 runs from 61 balls. He was selected for the Pakistan squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, where he was the highest run-scorer for his team.  In February 2017, he was suspended and later banned for his part in the 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing scandal.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSharjeel Khan made his first-class debut in 2009, scoring \na hundred in the second innings. In his Twenty20 (T20) games he made two T20 centuries.\nHe was first called up for Pakistan during Sri Lanka's tour of the UAE. While in his second international in a Twenty20 International (T20I) against Sri Lanka at Dubai, Khan made a promising 34 and suggested he could fix Pakistan's top-order conundrum. This was cemented in his third game, when he blasted a swashbuckling 50 off 25 balls against Sri Lanka. Khan became a regular in the Pakistan limited overs teams ever since his successful Pakistan Super League (PSL) in February 2016, where he made 299 runs (3rd highest) at 30.00. He also hit the most sixes in the inaugural PSL (19) and scored the first century for the PSL.\nIn September 2016, Khan earned his first test call-up against New Zealand after impressing in the limited overs against England and West Indies.After completing his five-year ban for breaching the Pakistan Cricket Board's Anti-Corruption code, he was given clearance by the board to resume club cricket. So, he will be part of the players draft for the fifth edition of PSL.\n\n\n=== 2016 Pakistan Super League ===\nKhan was part of Islamabad United's squad. He scored the first century of the tournament and 117 runs from 62 deliveries against Quetta Gladiators. He scored 300 runs in the tournament and finished the tournament as the third-leading run scorer.\n\n\n=== Ireland (2016) ===\nKhan scored his first century against Ireland at Malahide on 18 August 2016. His fifty came from 34 deliveries and century from 61 deliveries with a strike rate of 176.74. This century stands as the fourth-highest One Day International (ODI) score by a Pakistani, behind Fakhar Zaman (210*), Saeed Anwar (194) and Imran Nazir (160). His 150 also stands as the third-fastest of all time after AB de Villiers and Shane Watson.\n\n\n=== 2017 Pakistan Super League spot-fixing ===\n\nIn February 2017, Khan was provisionally suspended under the Anti-Corruption Code of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). This was part of an ongoing investigation into an organisation's alleged attempts to corrupt the 2017 Pakistan Super League. On 18 February, Khan, along with teammate Khalid Latif, was formally charged by the PCB for violating the anti-corruption code. On 20 March, he was summoned by the PCB Anti-Corruption tribunal for a hearing and was given until 5 May to submit a formal reply. On 30 August 2017, Sharjeel Khan was banned for 5 years from all forms of cricket after being found guilty on five counts in violation of the PCB's anti-corruption code. Two-and-a-half years out of the five-year sentence are suspended. Khan's ban took effect from when he was first suspended, on 10 February 2017. The Pakistan's dashing opening batsman Sharjeel Khan is all set to get back to the limelight cricket with the news of him being included in the drafts for the fifth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL). Playing his last game for Islamabad United in February 2017, Sharjeel missed two complete seasons of the tournament.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSharjeel Khan at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Craig Anthony Joseph Meschede (born 21 November 1991) is a South African-born German former cricketer. An all-rounder, he bowls right-arm medium-fast, and bats right-handed.\nHe made his debut for Somerset County Cricket Club in the 2011 Caribbean Twenty20, and played regular Twenty20 cricket for the county during the 2011 English domestic season. He also made occasional appearances in both first-class and one-day cricket. He received modest media coverage when he claimed the wicket of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar as his first in first-class cricket. Although he was born in South Africa, in May 2019, he was selected to represent the Germany national team.\nMeschede's career was cut short by injury at the age of 28, due to suffering from a neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== England ===\nMeschede was born in Johannesburg, South Africa to a German father. He attended King's College, Taunton, where he played a number of good innings. On the completion of his A-Levels, he signed a two-year contract with Somerset County Cricket Club, eligible to play as a non-overseas player due to his German passport. He made his debut for Somerset along with five other players during their opening match of the 2010\u201311 Caribbean Twenty20, when Somerset were missing a number of key players. Meschede was run out for one run in the match, which Somerset lost narrowly. He managed more runs in the remaining three matches of the competition, and finished with 55 runs in the tournament at an average of 27.50. He began the 2011 English domestic season playing for Somerset's second team, but got an opportunity in the middle of May for the first team, being selected for the Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Lancashire. He was not required to bat or bowl on his one-day debut, but was picked for the County Championship match during the same week. Facing Sussex, he scored 18 and 15 not out in an eight wicket loss for Somerset. After these matches, he returned to the second team until the middle of June, when he was called up for a Twenty20 match. He made a few appearances low in the order, but his best performance came when he batted at number three against Glamorgan, when he scored 53. He enjoyed little success with the bat in his other matches, irrespective of his position in the batting order, and finished with a batting average of 15.62 in the competition; his 53 being his only half-century. He enjoyed some modest successes as a bowler: against Essex, he took three wickets in just nine balls, during a match in which Essex were bowled out for 82 runs; Somerset won the match by 143 runs. In the competition as a whole, he was bowled sparingly, bowling just 63 balls, but his bowling average; 13.66 was second on the team behind Arul Suppiah.He claimed his maiden first-class wicket against the touring Indians, taking the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar. He played more regularly for Somerset towards the end of the 2011 season, when the side was affected by injuries, and scored his debut half-century in first-class cricket in the second innings of the match against Hampshire, reaching 53.On 18 November 2014, Meschede joined Glamorgan County Cricket Club on a season long loan for the 2015 season.On 21 April 2015, Meschede scored a career best and a match-saving 101 against Surrey in the county championship.On 25 January 2015, Meschede joined Glamorgan permanently on a three-year contract.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn February 2019, Meschede attended a training camp with the German national cricket team, with the view to help Germany qualify via the Regional Finals of the 2018\u201319 ICC World Twenty20 Europe Qualifier group for the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup. In May 2019, he was named in Germany's squad for the Regional Finals of the 2018\u201319 ICC T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier tournament in Guernsey. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for Germany, against Guernsey, on 15 June 2019. He finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, with 179 runs.\n\n\n=== Injury and retirement from cricket ===\nIn June 2020, Meschede announced his retirement at the age of 28 from professional cricket with immediate effect due to injury. He had been living with a neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome since mid-way through 2019, limiting his shoulder mobility and strength. After months of rehabilitation work Meschede took the advice of specialists to retire from the game.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCraig Meschede at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nCraig Meschede at ESPNcricinfo"

He was born in Johannesburg, Transvaal.\nPreviously, he played for South Africa's national side and made his Test debut for South Africa against Bangladesh on 30 July 2015.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nAfter four successful seasons at the Lions, Vilas moved to the Cape Cobras in search of more opportunity due to the emergence of Thami Tsolekile and Quinton de Kock at his former club.\nOn 27 January 2017, he signed a Kolpak deal with Lancashire, thus ruling him out of selection for South Africa.In August 2017, he was named in Pretoria Mavericks' squad for the first season of the T20 Global League. However, in October 2017, Cricket South Africa initially postponed the tournament until November 2018, with it being cancelled soon after.In October 2018, he was named in Jozi Stars' squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Durban Heat team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament.\n\n\n== International career ==\nVilas made his international debut against India in a one-off Twenty20 International. He then went with the South African team to a triangular between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. However, Vilas appeared to be out of form, and has not been picked for the T20 side since, with South African limited-overs captain AB de Villiers the new wicket-keeper. \nIn July 2015, he made his Test debut against Bangladesh at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur. The match was caught in a cyclone with four days washed out, and the series was drawn at 0\u20130. He was a late replacement for Quinton de Kock in the third Test against England on 14 January 2016, after de Kock suffered an injury before play started. Vilas arrived 45 minutes after the start of the match, after flying from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg.\n\n\n== Other ==\nVilas appeared in the 2008 film Hansie, about the life of former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje. He was cast as fast bowler Allan Donald by the producers, who wanted to add authenticity to on-field scenes by using real cricketers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDane Vilas at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Naved Arif Gondal (born 2 December 1981 in Mandi Bahauddin, Pakistan) is a former Pakistani cricketer. He is a left-handed batsman who bowls left-arm medium-fast.  He played first-class cricket for Sussex in the English county championship. Arif was given a life ban for match fixing in 2014.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Gujranwala Cricket Association ===\nNaved Arif began his career at Gujranwala in Pakistan. He made his first-class debut on 26 January 2002 against Hyderabad in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. He took 5\u201328 in his first innings. In his first season, he finished as the fourth highest wicket taker in his team despite only playing three matches. He took 19 wickets at an average of 16.05 and with an economy of 2.64. Arif made his List A debut on 28 February 2003 in the NBP Patrons Cup against Sargodha. He took 1\u201371 in his 10 overs and scored 49 runs from 37 balls. In his second season of first-class cricket at Gujranwala, Arif took 18 wickets in four matches at an average of 20.11.\n\n\n=== Sialkot Cricket Association ===\nIn the 2008/09 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, he represented Sialkot and played a key part in their victorious trophy winning team, playing eleven matches and taking 62 wickets at an average of 22.38. In the final he took 6\u201358 in the second innings to help set up a target of 158 runs for Sialkot to win the trophy which they achieved for the loss of 6 wickets. His six wicket haul in the final made him the leading wicket taker in the 2008/09 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy by a single wicket. In the 2009/10 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, Naved Arif achieved his career best figures of 7\u201366. He also took 3 wickets in the second innings to achieve his first ever 10 wicket haul in a match with overall match figures of 10\u201396.\n\n\n=== Rawtenstall Cricket Club ===\nNaved Arif signed for Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League in Northern England during the 2010 season. Arif was largely described as a big success despite taking time to come to terms with English conditions. He took 64 wickets during the season with an average of 18.00 and a best of 8\u201335 against Lowerhouse Cricket Club. He was also a useful run scorer for the club. He scored 769 runs at 40.5 with five half centuries. It was at Rawtenstall CC that Arif was given his nickname 'Barry' (as in the Great Barry Arif) a nickname that was adopted by his next club, Sussex.\n\n\n=== Sussex County Cricket Club ===\nIn February 2011, Sussex announced that they had signed Arif for the 2011 season. They stated that he would qualify to play as a non-overseas player due to his Danish-born wife. Mark Robinson, the Sussex coach, said that, \"Naved is a late developer, and with his background in Pakistan he's had to do it the tough way.\" He added, \"His record out there on unhelpful wickets is outstanding and he's got the potential to change games\". Naved Arif made his debut for Sussex in the County Championship match against Lancashire at Liverpool. Arif managed only 1 wicket in the match as Lancashire beat Sussex comfortably. He achieved cult hero status in his home debut at Hove. Once again, Sussex were facing almost certain defeat against Lancashire when Arif put on 90 runs with Monty Panesar for the 10th wicket to save the match. He also achieved his highest score in first-class cricket as he converted his first ever half century into an unbeaten century. Despite having the fourth best first-class average for Sussex in 2011, Naved Arif only played four matches. He took 15 wickets at 25.86. He made more of an impact in the List A campaign where he played twelve matches and took 9 wickets at 45.77 regularly bowling in tandem with fellow left handed fast bowler, Chris Liddle. In November 2011, Sussex announced that Naved Arif had signed a new one-year contract with Sussex. Naved stated, \"I want to say thank you to Sussex for keeping faith in me. I know I have so much more to give the team in 2012 and I aim to establish myself as a regular\". Cricket manager, Mark Robinson said, \"I\u2019m delighted that Naveed has agreed to come back for another year. Despite his age, he is still in many ways inexperienced. He is still learning and has got lots more to give.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nArif is married to a Danish citizen and therefore was qualified to play for Sussex as non-overseas player.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of cricketers banned for corruption\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNaved Arif at ESPNcricinfo"

An Intercontinental Cup match is a first-class international cricket match between two representative teams, each having first-class status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). A first-class match is played over three or four days, with each team having a maximum of two innings.The Cayman Islands joined became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1997, later in 2002, they became an associate member. The Cayman Islands first officially played in 2000, when the team faced the United States in the Americas Championship. The Cayman Islands were invited to compete in the 2005 Intercontinental Cup, playing two matches in the tournament against Bermuda and Canada, with both played at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. The Cayman Islands lost both these matches by heavy margins, thus eliminating from the competition. The Cayman Islands were not invited back to play in the next edition of the competition and are yet to play first-class cricket since. Cayman Island cricket has declined somewhat from the level at which it found itself in 2005 and now plays in World Cricket League Division Five.Only four players didn't play in both first-class matches: Keneil Irving, Kenute Tulloch, Marc Chin and Abali Hoilett. Pearson Best scored more runs than any other Caymanian with 121. The highest score by a Caymanian was Steve Gordon's 65 against Bermuda. Both Gordon and Best are the only Caymanians to make half centuries. Ryan Bovell has claimed more wickets in first-class matches than any other Caymanian, having taken 7. He also captained the team in both its first-class matches.\nThis list includes all players who have played at least one first-class match and is initially arranged in the order of debut appearance.

He has played first class, one day and Twenty20 cricket since 2004.\nSmit gave up leg spin bowling to increase his chances of selection for the South African national team as a wicket keeper, having once been tipped as the successor of Mark Boucher. Having failed to achieve a call-up, Smit subsequently resumed bowling for the Dolphins.\nSmit captained the Dolphins for a number of years but was replaced as captain by Morne Van Wyk, who was signed from South African franchise the Knights.\nIn March 2017, Smit signed a two-year contract to play county cricket in England for Derbyshire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDaryn Smit at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Raymond Berry Phillips (born 23 May 1954) is an Australian cricketer who was born and raised in New South Wales and originally represented that state, but moved to Queensland in 1979 and played for that state for many years. He was selected for the 1985 Ashes squad but did not appear in any of the Test matches on the tour.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPhillips made his club debut in 1971 aged 15. He toured Sri Lanka in 1971 with the Australian Schoolboys and played for NSW Colts for three years. His first job after school was working for Bert Oldfield.\n\n\n=== First Class Cricketer ===\nPhillips played three games for NSW but Steve Rixon was blocking his path so he moved to Queensland in 1979.Phillips scored his debut first class century in 1981\u201382.After Marsh retired in 1984, Phillips was considered a candidate for the keeping position for the tour of the West Indies. However the selectors preferred Roger Woolley, who had a better batting record, with Wayne Phillips as a backup. When Woolley was injured the selectors went for Wayne Phillips.\nWayne Phillips impressed enough on the tour to be kept as Australian keeper for the 1984\u201385 summer. When he was injured, selectors relied on Steve Rixon. Rixon and Wayne Phillips were selected as the keepers on the 1985 Ashes tour. Rixon had to drop out when it was revealed he had signed to tour South Africa and Ray Phillips was selected in his place.In the 1984\u201385 Sheffield Shield final, Phillips scored 53 and 47 in Queensland's one wicket loss.\n\n\n=== Ashes Tourist ===\nRay Phillips was the reserve keeper on the tour and did not play in any test matches. He played 7 first class games taking 13 catches with a top score of 39, against Worcestershire, where he took part in a 96 run stand with Alan Border.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nWayne Phillips' keeping declined over the 1985\u201386 summer and there were some calls to replace him with Ray Phillips. However, when Wayne was dropped as keeper in 1986, the selectors went for Tim Zoehrer.Phillips' last first glass game was the 1985\u201386 Sheffield Shield final, which Queensland lost.Ray Phillips retired from all forms of cricket in August 1986. He was replaced as Queensland's wicketkeeper by Peter Anderson.\n\n\n=== Post cricket career ===\nPhillips commentated cricket matches for ABC radio. He was also a selector for the Queensland cricket team. Phillips gained notoriety on social media site Reddit after commentating on a Cricket Australia live stream where he proceeded to complain about aspects of cricket and life in general including players performing hand shakes and high fives, players taking unscheduled drinks breaks, toasters, and his views that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had become too one-sided.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPhillips is Jewish.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New South Wales representative cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCricinfo profile\nCricketarchive profile"

He was banned from Indian cricket due to his signing with the rebel ICL. Subsequently, Mishra left the ICL and, following an amnesty offer from BCCI, returned to Indian domestic cricket.A middle-order batsman, Mishra made his first-class cricket debut for Madhya Pradesh against Railways in 2000/01 at the age of 16. However, he played just two games in that season. He also represented India at the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2002. But then he went through a period of four years without competitive cricket as he failed to impress the selectors of his state team. He made a comeback during the 2005/06 season, but his domestic career was cut short after he signed up with the Delhi Giants team in the now-defunct Indian Cricket League. Eventually the BCCI revoked its ban on the ICL players and Mishra returned to playing for his state team in 2009 and has been a regular member of the playing XI ever since. He signed up for Deccan Chargers in 2010. Mishra went on to play 11 matches for them that season. He had a highly successful first-class season in 2010/11 as he accumulated 718 runs in 9 matches at an average of 59.83. In 2011, he signed a contract with the new IPL franchise Pune Warriors India.He was suspended on 15 May 2012 for spot-fixing issue, after a local news channel, India TV reportedly accused him along with four other players based on a sting operation. After the corruption probe in June, Mishra was handed a one-year ban for bringing the game into disrepute while his Madhya Pradesh teammate TP Sudhindra was given a life-ban after he was found guilty of the charges.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMohnish Mishra at ESPNcricinfo\nYahoo!

A right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace, he was born at Cuckfield, Sussex.\nHansford made his debut in List A cricket for the Combined Universities against Surrey in the 1989 Benson & Hedges Cup. He played five matches for the Combined Universities side in that competition, which captained by Michael Atherton, famously reached the quarter-final of the competition by defeating professional first-class opposition along the way. Having played for the Sussex Second XI since 1987, it was in the 1989 season that he made his first-class debut for Sussex against Cambridge University at Hove, taking figures of 4/46 and 4/29 during the match. During his time at Sussex, he featured infrequently in first-class cricket, making just nine further appearances, the last of which came against Hampshire in the 1992 County Championship. Primarily a bowler, Hansford took 30 wickets in his ten first-class appearances, which came at an average of 33.03, with best figures of 5/79. These figures were his only first-class five wicket haul and came against Hampshire in 1989.He first featured in List A cricket for Sussex in his debut season, making his debut in that format for the county in the Refuge Assurance League against Hampshire. He featured in a total of seventeen List A matches for the county in 1989 and 1990, including taking what would be his only five wicket haul in one-day cricket, against Gloucestershire in 1989. In 1991, he once again featured for the Combined Universities in the Benson & Hedges Cup, making four appearances. Further appearances in that format for Sussex followed, with Hansford making five further appearances for the county, the last of which came against Northamptonshire in the Sunday League. In total, Hansford made 23 List A appearances for Sussex, taking 24 wickets at an average of 42.54.Michael Atherton later wrote that Hansford was the only gay cricketer he had come across, in response to a letter from Hansford in which he wrote \"there can't be too many gay accountants who dismissed you twice in a first-class match\" (in reference to Hansford's first-class debut against Cambridge University, in which he dismissed Atherton twice).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlan Hansford at ESPNcricinfo\nAlan Hansford at CricketArchive"

Gilchrist termed it completely against the spirit of the game.\n\n\n== Spot fixing allegation and arrest ==\n\nOn 16 May 2013, he was arrested on charges of spot-fixing during IPL 6 by the Delhi police along with Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan, who play alongside him for Rajasthan Royals.Chandila had allegedly received \u20b94.9 million (US$69,000) from bookies in the 2013 IPL season, of which \u20b91.5 million (US$21,000) was paid to him to spot-fix in the match against Mumbai Indians on 17 May 2013 before which he was arrested.

        "article": "The Leeward Islands cricket team is a composite cricket team representing the member associations of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the larger West Indies Cricket Board. The team incorporates players from several small islands in the Leeward Islands grouping of the Lesser Antilles, an island arc in the Caribbean Sea. These are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Nevis, Saint Kitts, Sint Maarten, and the United States Virgin Islands, although the sport is most popular in the islands that previously were part of the British Leeward Islands colony (in existence from 1833 to 1958). Although matches were played in the islands from the late 19th century, a combined team was not formed until the early 1950s, when semi-annual matches against a representative Windward Islands team commenced. The Leewards played its first match at first-class level in July 1958, against Jamaica.For the inaugural 1965\u201366 season of the Shell Shield, the Leewards and Windwards associations together entered a \"Combined Islands\" team, an arrangement which persisted on and off until the 1981\u201382 season, when the associations began to enter separate teams. However, the Leewards still played regularly at first-class level during this time, against other West Indian domestic teams and touring international teams. Since its re-entry into the main domestic first-class competition, the team has played every season, winning the competition four times (as sole winner during the 1989\u201390, 1993\u201394, and 1995\u201396 seasons, and shared with Guyana during the 1997\u201398 season). In total, the Leewards have played 225 first-class matches, winning 72, drawing 81, losing 72, and having five matches abandoned. Of these, 187 matches were played in the main West Indian domestic competition. A total of 184 players have played at least one first-class match for the team since its debut.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== List of players ==\nStatistics only include first-class matches played for the Leeward Islands, and are correct as of 7 June 2013.\n\n\n== List of captains ==\nTwenty-eight players have captained the Leewards in at least one first-class match, with Nevisian Stuart Williams' 38 matches between 1994 and 2004 the most of any one player. Of the team's captains, two were Anguillan, nine Antiguan, one Montserratian, seven Nevisian, eight Kittitian, and one of unknown nationality:\n\n\n== References =="

He is a right-arm fast-medium bowler who represented South Africa in Test, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket between 2013 and 2017, before retiring to take up a contract with Hampshire in English county cricket. He previously played in South African domestic cricket for the Dolphins.\nIn September 2019, Abbott took match figures of 17\u201386 in Hampshire's match against Somerset in the 2019 County Championship. These were the fourth-best figures in County Championship cricket in England, and the tenth-best figures of all time in first-class cricket. They were also the best match figures in first-class cricket since Jim Laker took 19\u201390 in the fourth Test against Australia in 1956.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\nIn 2006 and 2007 Abbott played his cricket for an English seaside town Clevedon Cricket Club which played in the West of England Premier League \u2013 Bristol Somerset. This was where he was recognized by Somerset County Cricket Club and represented their second team.\nIn 2015 Abbott was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in the IPL8 auction. He was included in the KZN Inland squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup. In 2016, Abbott was bought by the Kings XI Punjab in the IPL 9 auction.\nIn October 2018, he was named in Durban Heat's squad for the first edition of the Mzansi Super League T20 tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker for the team in the tournament, with ten dismissals in ten matches.In January 2019, he was signed by the Northern Knights to play in the 2018\u201319 Super Smash in New Zealand. In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Durban Heat team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. In April 2021, he was named in Boland's squad, ahead of the 2021\u201322 cricket season in South Africa.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe was named as the replacement for the injured Jacques Kallis in the South Africa national cricket team for the third Test against Pakistan in February 2013. He took seven wickets on debut in the 3rd Test against Pakistan in February 2013, where he was adjudged man of the match as well. These were the ninth best figures of all time for a debutant in test cricket.\nOn 5 January 2017 following the conclusion of the second Test against Sri Lanka, Abbott signed a Kolpak deal with Hampshire County Cricket Club which made him ineligible to represent South Africa anymore, ending his international career.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of South Africa cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKyle Abbott at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "A total of 67 players represented the East Pakistan cricket team in first-class matches between the team's debut in November 1954 and its final completed match in September 1969. Representing East Pakistan (East Bengal prior to 1955), a former provincial state of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the team can be considered a direct predecessor to the present national cricket team of Bangladesh, which declared independence in 1971. Prior to the partition of India in August 1947, cricketers from the region that is now Bangladesh generally played for Bengal, which had been active in Ranji Trophy matches since the 1935\u201336 season.Most of the team's matches at first-class level came in the domestic Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, while others were played in the Ayub Trophy or against touring international sides. The team first played in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy during the 1954\u201355 season, but did not appear again until the 1959\u201360 season, subsequently going on to field a team for seven consecutive tournaments (incorporating the 1961\u201362 to 1970\u201371 seasons). For other tournaments the province was split into several sides, including East Pakistan \"A\" and \"B\" and the East Pakistan Greens and Whites. Several other sides primarily fielding East Pakistani players also participated in Pakistani domestic competitions. In total, East Pakistan played 20 matches at first-class level, although two of these were abandoned without a ball being bowled.As regional Pakistani cricket teams were almost exclusively amateur at the time, the composition of the team was often highly unstable. Of the 67 players for East Pakistan, 26 played only a single match for the team, while only two played more than ten matches\u2014Abdul Latif, the team's highest-scoring batsman, played fifteen matches, captaining the side in ten, and Daulat Zaman played eleven. East Pakistan often fielded high-quality players from West Pakistan who had re-located to the province for employment or business commitments. These included six Test cricketers\u2014Mahmood Hussain, Mohammad Munaf, Mufassir-ul-Haq, Nasim-ul-Ghani, Naushad Ali, and Niaz Ahmed No native East Pakistanis, Bengali or otherwise, represented Pakistan's national side at Test level. The closest was Raqibul Hasan, who was twelfth man against the touring New Zealanders during the 1969\u201370 season, and the following season represented a full-strength Pakistan side against a Commonwealth XI. Raqibul went on to serve as Bangladesh's inaugural captain in the 1979 ICC Trophy, and later played two One Day International (ODI) matches for the team. Two other East Pakistan players went on to play for Bangladesh in ICC Trophy matches\u2014Ashraful Haque and Shafiqul Haque.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\n\n== List of players ==\n\n\n== List of captains ==\n\n\n== References =="

She was the first cricketer to take a hat-trick for Australia in a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) match.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSchutt was born in Adelaide, into what she has praised as a \"loving family\", headed by her parents Brian and Sue. According to Schutt, \"I'm 99 per cent my dad; I have my mum's eyes, but that's about it,\" and, \"I thank [my dad] for all my sporting-ness.\" However, he denies having been any good at sport.Together with her older sister Natalie, with whom she shared a bedroom, and her younger brother Warren, Schutt was raised in a modest home in Hackham West, an outer southern suburb of Adelaide. She attended Hackham West Primary School, then Wirreanda Secondary School, and although she loved school and achieved good grades, she also \"wagged a bit\".In Hackham West, children often played cricket in the suburban streets, and Schutt was amongst them. One day when she was 11 years old, she was asked to fill in for someone in a Seaford club match. During that game, she was bowled first ball, but took a wicket with her own first ball. She was also spotted by someone who invited her to join a new girls' team. After being spotted again playing for that team, she was recruited by the Flinders University Cricket Club. Then, at age 13, she moved to Sturt, where her team mates included Shelley Nitschke.Schutt proceeded along the South Australian state pathway through the under-15, under-17 and under-19 teams. Yet despite being a \"fluky good\" cricketer as a teenager, she took a long time to fall in love with the game. At 16, she tried boundary umpiring for an Australian rules football league, and was called-up to play football for a short time at junior level, but she soon returned to cricket. In 2018, she told Adelaide's Sunday Mail that until she was 19:\n\"I took things for granted and I had to figure out how lucky I was to be playing a sport amongst really good people and a sport that is an incredible sport, it's so simple yet so complicated. It took me to appreciate everything around me to actually fall in love with the game \u2026 and I'm glad I did.\"\nIn an article Schutt wrote for The Guardian in 2021, she observed that as an unexpected by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic she had been able to consider certain issues with more clarity:\n\"Some of this has been around equality in sport, a belated reflection on my childhood, of being the token girl who played sport at my school and the perception that was normal. Or of growing up believing women's cricket pathways were equal to their men's counterparts when they quite clearly were not.\"\n\n\n== Career ==\nA right-arm fast-medium bowler, Schutt made her international debut against New Zealand, a match in which she bowled expensively, conceding 33 runs from five overs. She collected two wickets in her next match, against the same opposition, and was rated by ESPNcricinfo's review of women's cricket in 2012 as a player to watch in the following year. She was selected as part of Australia's squad for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, something that ESPNcricinfo's Jenny Roesler suggested was due to Australia's lack of bowlers.During the World Cup, Schutt appeared in all of Australia's seven matches, claiming 15 wickets at an economy of 4.13. She took at least one wicket in each of the matches, and her 15 were the most by any bowler in the tournament. The Daily Telegraph described her rapid rise from playing club cricket to being the leading bowler in the World Cup as \"meteoric\", but Schutt explained that the humidity in India favoured her swing bowling. Schutt opened the bowling for Australia in the World Cup final against the West Indies, which her side won by 114 runs; she claimed two wickets for the concession of 38 runs in the match. Her best bowling performance for Australia was the three wickets for 40 runs she claimed in the World Cup group match against New Zealand.In June 2015, she was named as one of Australia's touring party for the 2015 Women's Ashes in England.In December 2017, she was named as one of the players in the ICC Women's T20I Team of the Year.\n\nIn March 2018, during the 2017\u201318 India women's Tri-Nation Series, Schutt became the first bowler for Australia Women to take a hat-trick in WT20Is. The following month, she was one of the fourteen players to be awarded a national contract for the 2018\u201319 season by Cricket Australia.\nIn June 2018, Schutt was named as the new captain of the South Australian Scorpions after the previous captain, Tegan McPharlin, chose to step down.In October 2018, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. Ahead of the tournament, she was named as one of the players to watch.In November 2018, she was named in the Adelaide Strikers' squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season. In April 2019, Cricket Australia awarded her with a contract ahead of the 2019\u201320 season. In June 2019, Cricket Australia named her in Australia's team for their tour to England to contest the Women's Ashes. In September 2019, in the third match against the West Indies, Schutt became the first Australian bowler to take a hat-trick in WODIs, and the first female bowler to take two hat-tricks in international cricket. In January 2020, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia. She finished as the leading wicket taker with 13 wickets in the tournament which also included taking 4/18 in the final.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSchutt's nickname is \"Shooter\". She came out as lesbian, and married her long-term partner Jess Holyoake in 2019. An early supporter of same-sex marriage in Australia, Schutt stated that \"saying partner is nice but when having to explain that it's a woman a lot of the time I think that often gets a reaction which isn't quite comfortable...now we're able to [just] say wife, flat out, and people know that's the deal.\" In May 2021, Schutt announced that Holyoake was expecting their first child.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Megan Schutt at Wikimedia Commons\n\nMegan Schutt at ESPNcricinfo \nMegan Schutt at CricketArchive  (subscription required)\nMegan Schutt at Cricket Australia"

        "article": "Amy Ellen Jones is an English cricketer who plays as a wicket-keeper and right-handed batter for Warwickshire, Central Sparks, Birmingham Phoenix and England. She made her England debut in 2013 and is a holder of an ECB central contract.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nJones was born in Solihull, West Midlands, and raised in nearby Sutton Coldfield, where she attended John Willmott School. Her first experience of organised sport was playing on a boys' football team for Aston Villa; she then joined Walmley Cricket Club and rose rapidly through the ranks. She has since commented:\n\n\"Some of my mates played cricket at the local club and I went down there. They had a girls' team and a successful ladies' team which wasn't common at the time. So, I was lucky and it was quite straightforward. They had good links with Warwickshire and I had a trial at Edgbaston at 13 and I went on from there.\"\nWhile still in her mid-teens, Jones represented the Warwickshire Academy and began to be selected for England Development and Academy programmes. In 2011, when she was 18, she was called up to the England Women's Academy at Loughborough University. By then, she was an accomplished wicket-keeper, and had already had her keeping assessed on occasional training sessions at the Academy. Soon after her callup, she was informed she was to become a full-time member of the Academy and deputy to then regular England team wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJones was the holder of one of the first tranche of 18 ECB central contracts for women players, which were announced in April 2014. In April 2015, Jones was named as one of the England women's Academy squad tour to Dubai, where England women played their Australian counterparts in two 50-over games, and two Twenty20 matches.  A member of the 2015 Women's Ashes squad, she played in the one-day matches but was replaced in the squad by Fran Wilson.\n\nIn October 2018, she was named in England's squad for the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. In November 2018, she was named in the Perth Scorchers' squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season.In February 2019, she was awarded a full central contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for 2019.In June 2019, the ECB named her in England's squad for their opening match against Australia to contest the Women's Ashes. The following month, she was also named in England's Test squad for the one-off match against Australia. She made her Test debut for England against Australia women on 18 July 2019.Upon the retirement of Sarah Taylor in late 2019, Jones became the first choice wicket-keeper for the England team. By then, she had already  kept wicket in 42 of her 80 England matches across all formats. In January 2020, she was named in England's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia.On 18 June 2020, Jones was named in a squad of 24 players to begin training ahead of international women's fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. She featured in all five matches, making a match best score of 55 in the fourth T20I.In June 2021, Jones was named in England's Test squad for their one-off match against India.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nJones is in a relationship with her Perth Scorchers teammate Piepa Cleary, a seam bowler from Australia. In 2021, after the relationship had been a long-distance one for some years, Cleary relocated to England and started playing for North West Thunder. Jones and Cleary are now both based in Loughborough, Leicestershire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Amy Jones (cricketer) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAmy Jones at ESPNcricinfo \nAmy Jones at CricketArchive  (subscription required)"

        "article": "In cricket, a player is said to have scored a century when he scores 100 or more runs in a single innings. Test cricket, the longest version of the game, involves two innings per side in a match. An individual scoring centuries in each innings of a Test match is considered a \"milestone\" by critics. Players from all teams that are full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) except Ireland and Afghanistan have scored centuries in both innings of a Test.The first player to score centuries in both innings of a Test match was Warren Bardsley of Australia, who made 136 and 130 against England in August 1909. Since then, the feat has been accomplished by 69 players on 86 occasions as of October 2019. India's Sunil Gavaskar, Australia's Ricky Ponting and David Warner are the only cricketers who have scored two centuries in match on three occasions, while 11 players have achieved the feat two times. England's Graham Gooch has the highest aggregate in a match while scoring centuries in both the innings; his combined tally of 456 runs in the match\u2014333 in the first and 123 in the second innings\u2014was entered into The Guinness Book of Records as \"Most runs scored by a player in a Test match (male)\". Allan Border is the only player to have scored 150 (or more) in each innings. Sri Lanka's Aravinda de Silva is the only player to remain not out in both innings.There have been five instances of two players performing the feat in the same match\u2014Denis Compton (England) and Arthur Morris (Australia) in 1947, Australia's Greg Chappell and Ian Chappell (against New Zealand) in 1974, Asanka Gurusinha (Sri Lanka) and Andrew Jones (New Zealand) in 1991, Pakistan's Azhar Ali and Misbah-ul-Haq (against Australia) in 2014, and David Warner (Australia) and Virat Kohli (India) in 2014.West Indies' Lawrence Rowe (1972) and Pakistan's Yasir Hameed (2003) are the only debutants to score centuries in both innings of a Test match.\n\n\n== Key ==\n\nInn1 \u2013 Score made by batsman in the first innings of the match\nInn2 \u2013 Score made by batsman in the second innings of the match\n* \u2013 Batsman remained not out\nDate \u2013 Starting date of the Test match\nWon \u2013 The match was won by the batsman's team\nLost \u2013 The match was lost by the batsman's team\nDrawn \u2013 The match ended in a draw\n\n\n== Table ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDonnelly, Paul (2010).

        "article": "Jessica Louise Jonassen (born 5 November 1992) is an Australian cricketer from Rockhampton, Queensland. A left-arm orthodox bowling all-rounder, Jonassen has been a member of the national women's team since 2012, going on to win four ICC T20 World Cups while becoming the fourth woman to have taken 100 One Day International wickets for Australia. Domestically, she is the current captain of both the Queensland Fire in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) and the Brisbane Heat in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL).\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJonassen was born in Emerald, a rural town in the Central Highlands Region of Queensland, but grew up approximately 270 km (170 mi) away in the coastal city of Rockhampton. She attended high school at Emmaus College, Rockhampton, graduating in 2009.When Jonassen was 10 or 11, she started playing cricket, initially at school and later for Rockhampton Brothers. She played in boys' teams; at that time, there were no girls only cricket programs in rural Queensland. Jonassen progressed through third grade and second grade levels, and eventually played a couple of A-grade games not long before she finished school and moved to Brisbane. There, she played for University of Queensland.After completing a law degree at Griffith University in 2015, Jonassen continued her studies by undertaking a graduate certificate in forensic mental health.\n\n\n== Domestic career ==\n\n\n=== Women's National Cricket League ===\n\nJonassen began playing for the Queensland Fire in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) during the 2008\u201309 season. Making her WNCL debut against the New South Wales Breakers just three weeks after her 16th birthday (scoring 12 not out off 16 balls and taking 0/21 from three overs in an eight-wicket loss), she went on to play every game of the season and finished with twelve wickets at an average of 19.83.During the 2010\u201311 season, Jonassen took her batting to a new level, scoring the fifth-most runs in the league with 228 at an average of 57 and earning Queensland's Player of the Year award. She won the same award again, as well as the league-wide Player of the Year title, for the 2014\u201315 season in which she took the second-most wickets (eleven at an average of 13.36) and scored 197 runs at 49.25 despite missing several games due to injury.Ahead of the 2020\u201321 season, Jonassen assumed the captaincy of Queensland, taking over from the retired Kirby Short.\n\n\n=== Women's Big Bash League ===\nJonassen signed with her local Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) team, the Brisbane Heat, as a marquee player for the competition's inaugural season. She took the fourth-most wickets during the 2016\u201317 season (18 at an average of 15.88), before the Heat were knocked out of the tournament via a crushing nine-wicket semi-final loss to the Perth Scorchers at the WACA.Two seasons later, Jonassen was at the centre of an iconic moment during the first WBBL|04 semi-final at Drummoyne Oval against the Sydney Thunder, bowling the final delivery of the match to Nicola Carey who initially appeared to hit the ball for a game-winning six until an unlikely catch by Haidee Birkett was taken metres inside the boundary rope. On the following weekend in the final against the Sydney Sixers, Jonassen contributed 1/28 from four overs as the Heat went on to win by three wickets to claim their maiden championship.Jonassen enjoyed an outstanding WBBL|05 campaign, notably increasing her output with the bat (scoring 419 runs at an average of 38.09) for which she credited an \"honest conversation\" with new coach Ashley Noffke. She also took the second-most wickets in the league with 22 at an average of 18.31 and won the Heat's Most Valuable Player award. In a four-wicket semi-final win over the Melbourne Renegades at Allan Border Field, Jonassen earned Player of the Match honours by taking 1/25 and scoring 38 off 23 balls. The following day, in the final against the Adelaide Strikers, she finished with match best bowling figures of 2/30 and contributed 33 runs. The Heat won by six wickets, thus becoming back-to-back champions.In July 2020, Jonassen signed a new contract to stay at Brisbane for another three years. The Heat also announced she would captain the team for WBBL|06.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\n\n=== 2012: Limited overs debut, first world championship ===\nJonassen made her international cricket debut in a Twenty20 match on 20 January 2012 against New Zealand at North Sydney Oval. She took two wickets for 28 runs from four overs, with her first scalp being Suzie Bates who was caught by Lisa Sthalekar for 33. In the second innings, Jonassen scored eight not out and put on an unbeaten 25-run partnership with Sarah Coyte to help Australia win by four wickets with one ball remaining.On 25 January 2012, Jonassen made her One Day International debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground against New Zealand in a match that was abandoned during the 23rd over due to rain, bowling just nine deliveries and finishing with figures of 0/5. She took her first ODI wicket four days later at Blacktown International Sportspark, helping Australia bowl out New Zealand for just 125 which led to a comfortable nine-wicket victory.At the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, Jonassen played all five games and claimed five wickets at an average of 14. She delivered her best performance of the tournament in the final against England, taking 3/25 from four overs with Australia winning the match by four runs.\n\n\n=== 2013\u201315: Second world championship, Test debut ===\nJonassen was named in Australia's squad for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup but, after failing to recover quickly enough from knee surgery on her medial meniscus in early January, she was withdrawn days before the team traveled to India for the tournament.On 20 August 2013, Jonassen made a strong return to international cricket by \"(spinning) Australia to victory\" at Lord's in the first ODI of the 2013 Women's Ashes. She took 4/38 from 8.3 overs in the 27-run win and, alongside fellow spinner Erin Osborne, orchestrated a batting collapse as England fell from 1/99 to 176 all out in the space of 20 overs.At the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, Jonassen played all six matches and took six wickets at an average of 19.16. She bowled tidily in the final against England, finishing with figures of 0/16 from four overs before Australia went on to win by six wickets to claim another world championship. Her role within the team during the tournament also consisted of being elevated to an opening batter for the semi-final and final. She continued in that position throughout Australia's next seven T20I matches, peaking with back-to-back Player of the Match performances against the West Indies in which she scored 46 off 51 balls on 2 November in a four-wicket win at North Sydney Oval and 47 off 39 balls on 5 November in an 86-run victory at Adelaide Oval.Jonassen made her Test debut at the St Lawrence Ground during the 2015 Women's Ashes. She played a critical hand with the bat in both innings which earned her Player of the Match honours and helped Australia defeat England by 161 runs. Coming to the crease on the first afternoon with her team in trouble at 4/87 (and 5/99 shortly thereafter), Jonassen formed two key partnerships\u2014a 77-run sixth-wicket stand with Alyssa Healy and a 68-run ninth-wicket stand with Kristen Beams\u2014to take the tourists to 8/268 at stumps. Resuming the second day on a score of 95, she could only manage four more runs before being dismissed lbw by Katherine Brunt on 99 off 197 balls and thus falling agonisingly short of a debut Test century. In the second innings of the match, Jonassen took her first Test wicket by bowling Georgia Elwiss for 17. She recorded another half-century in the third innings, this time making 54 off 72 to expedite the state of play and ensure Australia wrapped up victory on the fourth and final day.In the second T20I of the 2015 Women's Ashes at the County Ground in Hove, Jonassen was her team's equal-top scorer, making 21 runs off 16 balls. She also took 1/15 from three overs with the ball and two catches in the field, helping Australia defeat England by 20 runs and clinch a series victory.\n\n\n=== 2016\u201318: Knee injury, third world championship ===\n\nOn 22 February 2016, Jonassen achieved her first five-wicket haul in ODI cricket during a Rose Bowl match at the Bay Oval. She finished with figures of 5/50 from nine overs, helping restrict New Zealand to a total of 9/206 which Australia chased down with 54 balls remaining to win by eight wickets.In the first T20I of the 2017\u201318 Women's Ashes at North Sydney Oval, Jonassen took 1/14 off three overs in a six-wicket win which saw Australia retain the Ashes. Her only wicket occurred on the second ball of the match, removing England captain Heather Knight via caught behind for a duck. The dismissal was \"shrouded in confusion\" as Knight was first adjudged out by the officiating umpires, then not out and then out again. The MCC's Laws of Cricket Advisor Jonny Singer later argued that Knight should have been reprieved.Jonassen underwent knee surgery during September 2018 for the fourth time in her career. She made her return to international cricket on 29 October in a T20I against Pakistan at Kinrara Academy Oval. Despite being named in Australia's squad for the 2018 ICC World Twenty20, Jonassen did not play a match throughout the tournament which the team went on to win by defeating England in the final. In a blog post for The Athletes Voice, she described the experience of having to \"find ways to contribute to the team without being on the field\" as a mental health battle which led to \"some pretty dark places for a while\".\n\n\n=== 2019\u2013present: 100th ODI wicket, fourth world championship ===\nOn 22 February 2019, Jonassen pulled off a \"brilliant fightback\" with the ball in Australia's five-run ODI win against New Zealand at the WACA, taking 4/43 off ten overs. Two days later, she claimed her second five-wicket ODI haul, taking 5/27 off eight overs in a 95-run win at Karen Rolton Oval to help seal a series victory.In the ODI leg of the 2019 Women's Ashes, Jonassen averaged 74 with the bat and 15.6 with the ball, setting up a dominant tour in which the Australian team would only lose one game. She also took match best bowling figures of 2/19 off four overs in the second T20I at the County Ground in Hove, helping to defeat England by seven wickets.During a 110-run victory against Sri Lanka at Allan Border Field on 7 October 2019, Jonassen became the fourth woman to take 100 ODI wickets for Australia, joining Cathryn Fitzpatrick, Lisa Sthalekar and Ellyse Perry. Achieving the feat in 67 matches, she was the second-fastest woman from any country to reach the milestone, only behind Fitzpatrick's record of 64 innings.Jonassen managed her first T20I five-wicket haul in the final of the 2020 Tri-Nation Series at the Junction Oval, taking 5/12 off four overs to \"completely swing the momentum of the game\" and help her team defeat India by eleven runs. In the opening fixture of the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup at Sydney Showground Stadium, also against India, she finished with bowling figures of 2/24 but Australia would lose the match by 17 runs. Then in the tournament final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, meeting India once again, Jonassen took 3/20 as Australia successfully defended their world title with a commanding 85-run victory.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn February 2018, Jonassen became engaged to partner Sarah Gooderham. The couple planned to marry in May 2020 but postponed their wedding due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Jonassen is an avid supporter of the Western Bulldogs (an Australian rules football team) and has a pet French bulldog named Alfie. She is also a keen guitarist.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Team ===\n4x ICC Women's T20 World Cup champion: 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020\n2x Women's Big Bash League champion: 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320\nAustralian Women's Twenty20 Cup champion: 2013\u201314\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nWomen's National Cricket League Player of the Year: 2014\u201315\nQueensland Fire Player of the Year: 2010\u201311, 2014\u201315\nBrisbane Heat Most Valuable Player: 2019\u201320\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJess Jonassen at ESPNcricinfo \nJessica Jonassen at Queensland Cricket"

        "article": "Arthur J. Raffles (usually called A. J. Raffles) is a fictional character created in 1898 by E. W. Hornung, brother-in-law of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Raffles is, in many ways, an inversion of Holmes \u2013 he is a \"gentleman thief\", living at the Albany, a prestigious address in London, playing cricket as a gentleman (or \"amateur\") for the Gentlemen of England and supporting himself by carrying out ingenious burglaries. He is called the \"Amateur Cracksman\" and often, at first, differentiates between him and the \"professors\" \u2013 professional criminals from the lower classes.\nAs Holmes has Dr. Watson to chronicle his adventures, Raffles has Harry \"Bunny\" Manders \u2013 a former schoolmate saved from disgrace by Raffles, whom Raffles persuaded to accompany him on a burglary. Raffles is an expert thief and like Holmes, he is a master of disguise. Raffles's adventures have been adapted across various media, the character played by a number of popular actors including John Barrymore and David Niven.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nHornung was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories of his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle and dedicated The Amateur Cracksman to Doyle: \"To A. C. D. This Form of Flattery\". It has been suggested that Raffles's name may have been inspired by the title of Doyle's 1891 novel The Doings of Raffles Haw. Richard Lancelyn Green points out that Raffles shares his first name with Conan Doyle and with Hornung's son, Arthur Oscar Hornung. Raffles's initials are those of Hornung's housemaster at Uppingham School, A. J. Tuck and reversed, those of J. A. Turner, the cricket captain at Uppingham during 1882, Hornung's first year.The model for Raffles was George Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer, according to Andrew Lycett. Hornung and Ives played cricket for the Authors Cricket Club. Ives was privately homosexual and although Hornung \"may not have understood this sexual side of Ives' character\", Raffles \"enjoys a remarkably intimate relationship with his sidekick Bunny Manders\". Owen Dudley Edwards writes that Raffles and Bunny are \"an imitation of Holmes and Watson which is very obviously homosexual\", while C. P. Snow, in a 1975 review, describes their relationship as juvenile and innocent but with homosexual undertones. Raffles is also shown to have romantic relationships with the Neapolitan girl Faustina (in \"The Fate of Faustina\") and an artist using the name Jacques Saillard (in \"An Old Flame\"). Biographer Peter Rowland notes that these relationships are not shown until the second Raffles story collection, The Black Mask.Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders were also fictionalised versions of Oscar Wilde and his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. Characters in Hornung's 1896 short story \"After the Fact\" were prototypes for Raffles and Bunny. In \"After the Fact\", which is set in Australia, a young man, Bower, discovers that the man he used to fag for at school, Deedes, is a burglar. Hornung explained in an interview with Tit-Bits in 1909:\n\nA good many years ago I wrote a story about a public-school villain; he committed a terrible crime in Australia, and was met by his old fag, who shielded him. Unfortunately, I killed the villain at the end of the story. One day my brother-in-law, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, to whom I owe a very great deal, said to me, 'What a pity you killed that fellow! A public-school villain would be a new figure for a series. Why not revive him?' 'I don't believe I could write such a series to save my life,' I replied. However, I was advised to think the suggestion over. I did so, and the eventual result was a variation of the type in the shape of Raffles.\n\"After the Fact\" was inspired by Hornung's travels in Australia and by his only experience with a real burglar, which occurred while the author was living at Teddington, England. Hornung described the incident to Tit-Bits in 1909 when discussing Raffles, though the burglar was unimpressive and nothing like the gentleman thief character. Hornung had been asked by a house's caretakers to help them catch a burglar, who tried to hide in a space under the kitchen floor but was ultimately apprehended by a policeman.In his book Raffles and His Creator, Peter Rowland states that Deedes is Raffles's prototype, but also differs significantly from Raffles. While Raffles and Deedes are both charismatic, Raffles has a code of honour and \"is not really evil at all\" according to Rowland, whereas Deedes \"turns very nasty indeed\" after Bower tries to get him to return the money he stole. Rowland writes that \"Hornung (having passed the midway point of his story) had realised that he was on very dangerous ground and had speedily de-glamorised Deedes. Morality had been asserted at the eleventh hour, and justice had to be administered without further ado.... After experimenting with his new concept in 'After the Fact', Hornung was aware that his amateur cracksman would have to be a thoroughly decent chap even if he is a bit of a law-breaker.\" Furthermore, Raffles views burglary as a sporting challenge and has a prominent position in society (as a gentleman cricketer), unlike Deedes, who is only after money and is a social outcast.\n\n\n== Fictional biography ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nRaffles has a sister. At his public school, Raffles played cricket and was captain of the eleven. He also played rugby football. He attended the same public school as Bunny, who was Raffles's fag (a junior student who does menial jobs for an older student). In \"The Ides of March\" Bunny says that Raffles was kind to him at school. In turn, Bunny would help Raffles  sneak out of their dormitory at night, pulling up the rope after him and later letting it down for him to climb back in. Raffles stole at least one policeman's helmet while at Oxford according to the short story \"A Costume Piece\", but was a member of the Cambridge cricket team according to \"The Field of Philippi\". Raffles eventually becomes a gentleman cricketer. At one point, he goes to Australia to play cricket and commits his first burglary there, as he tells Bunny in \"Le Premier Pas\". He uses the prestige of his sporting fame to maintain his standing in London society, while secretly supporting himself with burglary. Raffles plays for multiple cricket clubs and teams, including I Zingari, the Gentlemen against the Players, the Middlesex eleven, and the English team. He lives in the Albany, a prestigious residential building in London.\nTen years after they were at their public school together, Raffles meets Bunny again when they play baccarat with others in \"The Ides of March\". Raffles saves Bunny from disgrace and suicide, and Bunny becomes his accomplice. \"The Ides of March\" takes place in March 1891 (according to biographer Peter Rowland). Raffles and Bunny act as \"amateur\" (gentleman) thieves and rob wealthy members of London society while appearing respectable. They encounter a rival thief, Crawshay, in \"Gentlemen and Players\" and again in \"The Return Match\". Scotland Yard detective Inspector Mackenzie, who is first mentioned in \"A Costume Piece\" and is first seen by Bunny in \"Gentlemen and Players\", is suspicious of Raffles. Inspector Mackenzie ultimately exposes Raffles and Bunny as burglars in  \"The Gift of the Emperor\" on a passenger liner. Raffles jumps overboard, and is believed to have drowned, while Bunny is arrested and serves a term of eighteen months in prison.\nRaffles survives and goes to Italy, where he endures hardships, as he later tells Bunny in \"The Fate of Faustina\". Raffles returns to England, and in \"No Sinecure\", set in May 1897, Raffles, now in disguise so that the police will not realize he is alive, reunites with Bunny. They become \"professional\" thieves and no longer have their old positions as respectable gentlemen in society. Initially, Raffles pretends to be an invalid named Mr. Maturin living under a doctor's supervision in an Earl's Court flat, with Bunny as his nurse. After Raffles fakes his death a second time in \"An Old Flame\", they move to a cottage owned by a genial landlady on the edge of Ham Common, where Raffles pretends he is Bunny's brother Ralph. In December 1899, Raffles and Bunny become interested in the Boer War. In 1900, they decide to volunteer for service in the war, leaving England in February and enlisting in South Africa. Six months after first taking an interest in the war, Raffles is killed in battle. Bunny, wounded in battle, eventually returns to England and writes about his adventures with Raffles.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nAt the start of the series, Raffles has piercing steel blue eyes, curly black hair, pale skin, an athletic build, a strong, unscrupulous mouth, and is clean-shaven. Raffles once had a heavy moustache, but apparently shaved it after his first burglary. As Raffles tells Bunny: '\"I used to have rather a heavy moustache,\" said Raffles, \"but I lost it the day after I lost my innocence.\"' He is some years older than Bunny, who is thirty years old in \"An Old Flame\", which takes place sometime after Raffles and Bunny reunite in \"No Sinecure\".\nAfter the time skip, Raffles's appearance is considerably aged due to his hardships abroad. His face is more wrinkled and pale than before, he appears weakened, and his hair has turned completely white. His sharp eyes and strong mouth, however, are unchanged. His physical strength later returns to him when he and Bunny move to live in the suburbs, where Raffles also wears clouded spectacles during the day to partially conceal his face.Raffles dyes his hair after he decides to volunteer for military service in 1900, to make sure he is not recognized by officers he knew in the past. According to Bunny, Raffles acquires \"a bottle of ladies' hair-dye, warranted to change any shade into the once fashionable yellow\", though Raffles is ultimately \"ginger-headed\" by the end of January, shortly before they leave England.\n\n\n=== Personality ===\nRaffles is charismatic and has \"the subtle power of making himself irresistible at will\", as stated by Bunny. Raffles is cynical about society, and is aware that his social position depends upon his status as a cricketer. At one point, he comments \"we can't all be moralists, and the distribution of wealth is all wrong anyway\". He does have scruples, despite his profession \u2013 he will not steal from his host, and will not kill to accomplish a burglary. (He does kill once under different circumstances according to the story he recounts in \"The Fate of Faustina\" and plans to at another time in \"Wilful Murder\".) He tells Bunny that he would settle down permanently if he could just make a big enough haul. He is also very patriotic.In \"Gentlemen and Players\", Raffles claims he has lost all enthusiasm for cricket, and keeps it up only as a cover for his real occupation (which he considers more exciting) and as mental exercise. However, Bunny observes that Raffles practises earnestly before the first match of the season, and that when Raffles did play, \"there was no keener performer on the field, nor one more anxious to do well for his side.\"Though Raffles is driven by economic necessity, he also pursues burglary as a sporting challenge, and considers himself a sort of artist. Some of his crimes do not involve a motive for profit. In a late story, he steals a gold cup from the British Museum on impulse: when challenged by Bunny as to how he will dispose of it, he posts it to the Queen as a Diamond Jubilee present. In \"The Field of Philippi\", he steals money from a tight-fisted Old Boy and donates it all to their former school, partly to spite the man. His last crime, committed just before he goes off to the Boer War, is to steal a collection of memorabilia of his crimes from Scotland Yard's Black Museum.\nWhile Raffles sometimes keeps parts of his plans secret from Bunny for various reasons, for instance to keep Bunny from inadvertently revealing something, he knows that Bunny's loyalty and bravery are to be relied on utterly. In several stories, Bunny saves the day for the two of them after Raffles gets into situations he cannot get out of on his own.\nRaffles is partial to Sullivan cigarettes and keeps them in a silver cigarette case.\n\n\n=== Skills ===\n\nOne of the things that Raffles has in common with Sherlock Holmes is a mastery of disguise \u2013 during his days as an ostensible man-about-town, Raffles keeps the components of various disguises in a studio apartment in Chelsea, which he maintains under a false name. He can imitate the regional speech of many parts of Britain flawlessly, and is fluent in Italian.Raffles is adept at using burglary tools such as hand drills and skeleton keys. He also uses more unusual tools of his own invention, including a rope-ladder which can be concealed under his waistcoat and hooked up with a telescopic walking-stick, and a small velvet bag designed to silence the sound of filing a skeleton key. These tools are used in various stories and displayed together in Scotland Yard's Black Museum in \"The Raffles Relics\". He has a small dark lantern in \"The Ides of March\" and uses a collapsible opera hat as a makeshift lantern in \"The Rest Cure\". He takes time to examine places he intends to steal from in advance, and is capable of improvising when the need arises.Raffles is also skilled as a cricketer. In \"Gentlemen and Players\", Bunny describes Raffles as \"a dangerous bat, a brilliant field, and perhaps the very finest slow bowler of his decade\". Raffles believes that bowling provides good mental practice for \"always looking for the weak spot\", and Bunny, while watching Raffles play, notices how Raffles's skills as a cricketer overlap with his skills as a thief: \"What I admired, and what I remember, was the combination of resource and cunning, of patience and precision, of head-work and handiwork, which made every over an artistic whole. It was all so characteristic of that other Raffles whom I alone knew!\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Raffles stories were instantly popular in Britain. Raffles became the second most popular fictional character of the time, behind Sherlock Holmes. Raffles has also been called the most famous fictional cricketer.In his 1944 essay \"Raffles and Miss Blandish\", George Orwell writes that Raffles and Bunny hold themselves to certain standards of behaviour as gentlemen even though they are criminals, in contrast with the violent criminals of then-contemporary crime fiction. Orwell, who calls Raffles \"one of the best-known characters in English fiction\", states that \"the charm of Raffles is partly in the period atmosphere and partly in the technical excellence of the stories.... However, the truly dramatic thing, about Raffles, the thing that makes him a sort of byword even to this day (only a few weeks ago, in a burglary case, a magistrate referred to the prisoner as 'a Raffles in real life'), is the fact that he is a gentleman.\"Orwell says in his essay that, though Raffles and Bunny \"are devoid of religious belief, and they have no real ethical code, merely certain rules of behaviour\", they \"are gentlemen, and such standards as they do have are not to be violated. Certain things are 'not done', and the idea of doing them hardly arises. Raffles will not, for example, abuse hospitality. He will commit a burglary in a house where he is staying as a guest, but the victim must be a fellow-guest and not the host.\" Orwell also comments that Raffles's crimes are relatively minor, and that the stories contain very little \"sensationalism\" in the form of violence, unlike many other works of crime fiction, including novels written from the perspective of a detective.Literary critic Stuart Evers said of the Raffles stories, \"Their off-kilter plotting and sometimes hysterical style, which Hornung uses to great effect to show Bunny's emotionally erratic state, may date them. But the constant inventiveness and sly wit of Hornung make every one a real joy. They are among the great treasures of crime writing, and should be cherished as such.\"\n\n\n== Influence ==\nRaffles has been described as \"the classic gentleman thief\". The character contributed to the archetype of the gentleman criminal who has a code of honour, only steals from the rich, and is drawn to burglary for the sport as much as for the money.A. J. Raffles appeared in print before author Maurice Leblanc created the French gentleman thief character Ars\u00e8ne Lupin in 1905. Jess Nevins writes that Raffles is better known than Lupin in English-speaking countries, though Lupin has been more widely imitated in the popular literature of Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Martin Edwards states that Lupin was heavily influenced by Raffles. According to Federico Pagello, the Raffles series was the most influential predecessor to the Lupin series, though both series were also influenced by the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The gentleman thief character Raffles (Lord Lister), introduced in a German magazine in 1908, was an imitation of Hornung's Raffles.The British press used Raffles as a synonym for a real-life thief in at least forty-seven newspaper articles in the period 1905\u20131939, in many cases in the headlines. Examples include the articles \"'Raffles' in Real Life\" (Daily Express, 1907), \"Exploit of a 'Raffles'\" (Daily Herald, 1927), and \"A MOdern Raffles\" (Police Journal, 1939). The same usage can be seen in press reports from the same period in other countries, such as \"'Cat' Burglar: A Modern Raffles\" (Brisbane Courier, 1927) and \"Feminine Raffles Comes to Grief\" (Los Angeles Times, 1927). Raffles has also been referenced in newspaper articles about real thefts since this period.While Raffles and Bunny were inspired by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, several of the Holmes stories, including the story of his return from the dead, were not published until after the first two collections of Raffles short stories, The Amateur Cracksman and The Black Mask, were published in 1899 and 1901 respectively. Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Holmes in \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\" (1893) and did not write of him again until The Hound of the Baskervilles (serialised 1901\u20131902), which is set before \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\". Peter Rowland writes that Doyle's biographers generally acknowledge that his decision to return Holmes to life in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" in October 1903 was prompted by Hornung's success with A. J. Raffles, who had been returned to life in the 1901 story \"No Sinecure\" after his supposed death in an earlier story. The grand reveal scene in \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", when Holmes drops his disguise, parallels Raffles's own reveal scene in \"No Sinecure\". Thus, while the pre-hiatus Sherlock Holmes stories influenced the Raffles stories, this relationship would later be reversed.The plot of the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\" (1904) was inspired by the Raffles story \"Wilful Murder\" (1899), according to Richard Lancelyn Green. A character in the Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear (1915), Scottish police detective Inspector MacDonald, may have been inspired by the Scottish police detective Inspector Mackenzie of the Raffles stories, though the two inspectors are very different in character.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nA.

Most of the short stories were first published in magazines.\n\nThe Amateur Cracksman (1899, 8 short stories)\nThe Black Mask (1901, 8 short stories)\nA Thief in the Night (1905, 10 short stories)\nMr. Justice Raffles (1909 novel)Raffles also features in pastiches written by Barry Perowne, Peter Tremayne, Richard Foreman, and other authors.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nLike Holmes, the Raffles stories have been adapted into multiple forms of popular media across the 20th and 21st centuries, some even co-authored by Hornung himself.\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nKyrle Bellew portrayed Raffles in the premiere of Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman, a play by Hornung and Eugene Presbrey, which opened on 27 October 1903 in New York.

A powerful right-handed top-order batsman, he made his debut for the United Arab Emirates national side in December 2010, having previously represented Sialkot and Servis Industries in Pakistani domestic tournaments. In March 2021, Shaiman was found guilty of corruption and banned from all cricket for eight years.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAs of February 2015, Shaiman lived in Dubai with his wife and children, working as an administrative executive at a petroleum storage terminal in Al Quoz. His younger brother, Arsalan Anwar, also played at first-class level for Sialkot, but retired early to concentrate on his career.\n\n\n== Domestic and T20 franchise career ==\nBorn in Sialkot, Shaiman made his debut for Sialkot in March 2002, during the 2001\u201302 season of the One-Day National Tournament. He made his first-class debut during the following season of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, and in his third match, against the Lahore Whites, scored a maiden century. Opening the batting with Usman Mushtaq, Shaiman scored 106 runs from 118 balls, putting on a 177-run opening stand. Later in the season, against Faisalabad in the limited-overs competition, he scored 96 from 91 balls, and was named man of the match. Despite his good form during the 2002\u201303 season, in the next season Shaiman played only at lower grades. However, he did play a single Twenty20 match for the Sialkot Stallions in the ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup during the inaugural 2004\u201305 season, as well as one Patron's Trophy match for Servis Industries during the 2005\u201306 season.Having previously played club cricket, Shaiman moved permanently to the UAE in 2007, after gaining employment with a shipping firm. His first matches for Emirati representative sides came during the 2009\u201310 season, when he played for United Arab Emirates A against Pakistan A and the England Lions. After meeting the qualification requirements, Shaiman made his senior debut for the UAE national team in the final of the 2009\u201310 ICC Intercontinental Shield, which the team lost to Namibia. Shaiman has since been a regular for the UAE, and across the 2011\u201313 WCL Championship, scored 625 runs from 14 matches, the most of any player.On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Edmonton Royals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHe made his One Day International (ODI) debut in February 2014, against Scotland in the final of the World Cup Qualifier, and his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut in March 2014, against the Netherlands in the World Twenty20. Shaiman was selected in the Emirati squad for the 2015 World Cup, and in the team's first match, against Zimbabwe, top scored with 67 from 50 balls. In the next match, against Ireland, he scored 106 from 83 balls, becoming the second UAE player to hit an ODI century (after Khurram Khan) and the first to do so in a World Cup.In the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup clash v Ireland, he along with Amjad Javed set the World Cup record partnership of 107 runs for the 7th wicket, which was eclipsed in July 2019 by MS Dhoni, RA Jadeja. In fact, this pair of batsmen became the first pair to have had a 100+ run stand for the 7th wicket in World Cup history.On 14 April 2017, he became the first player for the United Arab Emirates to score a century in a T20I match, when did against Papua New Guinea at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Anwar also became the first UAE player to score centuries in both ODIs and T20Is.\nHe also holds the record for facing the most number of balls in a T20I innings when batting at number three position (68).In January 2018, he was named in the United Arab Emirates's squad for the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament.In March 2018, during the United Arab Emirates match against Zimbabwe in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, Anwar became the first batsman for the United Arab Emirates to score 1,000 runs in ODIs. In August 2018, he was named in the United Arab Emirates' squad for the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier tournament. In December 2018, he was named in the United Arab Emirates' team for the 2018 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.In September 2019, he was named in the United Arab Emirates' squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the UAE. Ahead of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named him as the key player in the UAE's squad. However, the following month, he was dropped from the UAE's squad for the tournament. Two days before the start of the tournament, the ICC confirmed that Anwar had been suspended, after breaching cricket's anti-corruption rules. In January 2021, the ICC found him guilty of corruption in relation to attempted match-fixing. In March 2021, Shaiman was given an eight-year ban from all cricket, backdated to 16 October 2019, after being found guilty on charges of corruption.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShaiman Anwar at ESPNcricinfo\nShaiman Anwar at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

She is a right-handed batter and right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Queensland Fire in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) and the Brisbane Heat in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL). In April 2021, Kimmince announced her retirement from top-level cricket.\n\n\n== Cricket ==\nKimmince made her debut for Queensland aged 17 and her debut for Australia aged 18 against New Zealand in March 2008. The following year, she played in the Women's Cricket World Cup, but she then took a long break from cricket, during which time Kimmince moved to London and worked in the Princess Louise pub in Holborn. During this time, Kimmince was talked into playing for Warwickshire and took a three-hour train journey each way to matches each week without attending training.Kimmince returned to state cricket for the 2012\u20133 season, and in 2014 returned to playing for Australia, playing in the ICC World T20 tournament in Bangladesh, and in a series against Pakistan at home.In June 2015, Kimmince was named as one of Australia's touring party for the 2015 Women's Ashes in England, as a Twenty20 specialist.  However, she was later ruled out due to a lower back issue.In October 2015, Kimmince assumed the captaincy of Queensland Fire, replacing Jodie Fields, who was recovering from shoulder surgery.  Soon afterwards, Kimmince became the inaugural captain of Brisbane Heat, but in January 2017, she stepped down from that role and was replaced by Kirby Short.In April 2018, she was one of the fourteen players to be awarded a national contract for the 2018\u201319 season by Cricket Australia. In October 2018, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies.In November 2018, she was named in Brisbane Heat's squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season. In April 2019, Cricket Australia awarded her with a contract ahead of the 2019\u201320 season.In June 2019, Cricket Australia named her in Australia's team for their tour to England to contest the Women's Ashes. On 4 July 2019, in the second Women's One Day International (WODI) match of the Women's Ashes, Kimmince took her first five-wicket haul in WODIs. In January 2020, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia.\n\n\n== Australian rules football ==\nOn 26 September 2016, Kimmince was announced as the Brisbane Lions' second rookie signing for the inaugural AFL Women's (AFLW) season in 2017. She made her AFLW debut for Brisbane in their Round 6, 2017 clash with the Western Bulldogs. At the end of the 2017 season, she was delisted by the Lions.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKimmince became engaged to her Brisbane Heat teammate Laura Harris in November 2019, after dating Harris for four years.  They married in Marburg, Queensland in August 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDelissa Kimmince at AustralianFootball.com\nDelissa Kimmince at ESPNcricinfo \nDelissa Kimmince at CricketArchive  (subscription required)\nDelissa Kimmince at Cricket Australia"

He was excluded from service in World War II due a hearing impediment, which allowed him to play wartime county cricket. His next appearance in first-class cricket came after the war in 1946 against Surrey, before playing a third and final first-class match against Yorkshire in the 1951 County Championship, a match which also served as Jepson's benefit match, one which Hodgkins played in by way of an invite. He scored 109 runs in his three matches, top-scoring with 44, while with the ball he took three wickets.He died at Stanton-on-the-Wolds, Nottinghamshire on 16 August 1988.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Hodgkins at ESPNcricinfo\nJohn Hodgkins at CricketArchive"

        "article": "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language biographical sports drama film written and directed by Neeraj Pandey. It is based on the life of former Test, ODI and T20I captain of the Indian national cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The film stars the late Sushant Singh Rajput as Dhoni, along with Disha Patani, Kiara Advani, and Anupam Kher. The film chronicles the life of Dhoni from a young age through a series of life events.\nThe idea of the biopic was put forward by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey, after encountering an incident at an airport after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. Development began two years later, with the consent of Dhoni. Neeraj Pandey was later approached to helm the film while he was working on Baby. Pandey recruited a number of people for researching into Dhoni's background and his life events. Dhoni eventually became a consultant on the film.\nThe film was released on 30 September 2016 by Fox Star Studios and received the widest release ever for a Bollywood film across 61 countries. In addition to being released in Hindi language, it was also dubbed in Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi languages, although the Marathi release was later cancelled due to opposition. Upon release, the film became a critical and commercial success. It is currently the fifth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2016 in India with \u20b91.16 billion (US$16 million).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the pre-credits sequence there is a scene of the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. MS Dhoni, India's captain, walks out to bat after Kohli's wicket.\nThe film begins in Ranchi, 7 July 1981. At the hospital maternity unit, Paan Singh Dhoni (Anupam Kher) is confused whether he has got a girl or boy. He later names his baby boy Mahendra 'Mahi' Singh Dhoni. Paan Singh is a pump operator who waters the practice ground. Fourteen years later, Mahi is spotted by a cricket coach (Rajesh Sharma) while goalkeeping in a football game. He invites him to try out for the school cricket team as a wicketkeeper and selects him after being impressed. Mahi improves his batting and becomes a regular member of the team.\nThree years later, A Grown Up Mahi (Sushant Singh Rajput) helps win an inter-school cricket match. After achieving much fame, Mahi is selected for the Ranji Trophy but his draft notice is held up due to which he is late in reaching Kolkata despite his friends' help. But Mahi does not give up and, to please his father, he joins the Kharagpur Station as a ticket collector. Years later, Mahi's sister Jayanti (Bhumika Chawla) is married to his friend Gautam Gupta.\nAfter some time, Mahi is depressed with his job. With the insistence of his manager, Mahi decides to play cricket alongside his work, and after his day-shifts he goes to practice cricket. He participates in different tournaments and as a result he gets selected for the Railways. After a good performance, he tries-out for the India national under-19 cricket team selections. Bihar loses to Punjab where Yuvraj Singh scores 301 and Mahi does not succeed though he is selected for the Duleep Trophy.\nMahi leaves his job and admits to his father that cricket is his only ambition and he wants to become a professional cricketer. He works hard and is selected in the national team and makes his debut. He meets and befriends Priyanka Jha (Disha Patani), an office consultant, and scores a century after meeting her. She buys a watch for him as a Valentine's Day gift but dies in a truck accident on her way. Mahi again goes into depression and has bad form in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. As captain of the national side, he wins the T-20 World Cup, and leads India to the number one ranking in Test matches.\nIn 2010, Mahi arrives at a hotel. Sakshi Singh Rawat (Kiara Advani), a hotel official fails to recognize him and later apologizes to him. They soon start dating and Mahi eventually proposes marriage to her after she mentions buying him a Valentine's Day's gift which he refuses. They marry and Mahi begins training for the 2011 World Cup. He eventually develops the team with new players. The film returns to the final where Mahi eases the pressure with a crucial innings. With 4 runs required, Mahi hits a six and India wins the final. His family, friends and coaches watching the match cry happy tears.\nAfter the credits, the real MS Dhoni walks by the boundaries.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nDevelopment of a Dhoni biopic began after the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final and the discussion about the idea went on over the following years but remained dormant. Then, after a few years, Dhoni was at an airport when a child approached him and asked him a question on motivation. Dhoni sat down with the young boy and spent 5 minutes answering the question. His manager, Arun Pandey, asked why he spent that much time and Dhoni replied how his answer was pivotal in benefiting and motivating the boy. This incident then prompted Pandey to make a film about him saying [to Dhoni] that his story has the power to motivate millions of children like him. After the idea coalesced, Pandey began to convince Dhoni himself in order to adapt his life into a full-length feature film. When he was first approached on the idea of the adaptation, he became a little worried and questioned the need for it. But after being convinced by his peers, all he said was, \"Don't misrepresent me. Show me as I am.\" It took Dhoni two years to finally agree.\nAccording to International Business Times, the film carries a production budget of around \u20b91.04 billion (US$15.6 million).\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nPandey was attracted to Dhoni's story not because of his successful cricket career, saying that \"it's foolish to chase MS Dhoni's life story only because it's about cricket,\" but rather to instances and factors that made him the person he is today. Dhoni wasn't involved in writing the script. Pandey recruited a team of researchers who collated data and background information while the director was busy directing Baby (2015). The filmmakers decided that they would only green-light the film once they had a convincing story to tell after the research. Pandey met with Dhoni numerous times over a span of eight months and by the eighth month of their meetings, in 2014, the main arc of the story began to form. Their first meeting took place in Delhi during a cricket match. During their sporadic meetings, Pandey chose not to record and tape their conversations which prompted Dhoni to open up more.Arun Pandey says 98% of the content in the film is reality. The team undertook two years of research on the various incidents and how they took place. Pandey says \"such authenticity would be hard to find even in Hollywood.\" Pandey revealed several prominent aspects of Dhoni's life that were hidden before including the fact that Dhoni initially disdained cricket and had a predilection for football instead, his signature \"helicopter shot\" was taught to him by his friend Santosh Lal, he likes women who don't recognise him, he and Yuvraj Singh had close ties even before their respective stardom and it was Dhoni who ousted Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid from the team since he wanted to build a young team for the 2011 World Cup with better fielders and he wasn't too happy with the 'fitness' levels of the aforementioned cricketers.Pandey decided to end the film with the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final since he felt \"the arc of the story had a natural high at the 2011 World Cup win.\" He knew that they were chronicling almost 30 years of a sportsman's life \"in a highly compressed manner\" and said that had he extended the script to his sudden retirement during an ongoing series, the run time of the film would shoot up to six hours.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nNeeraj Pandey was in the midst of shooting Baby (2015) when Arun Pandey, the manager of Dhoni, offered him an opportunity of making a biopic based on Mahendra Singh Dhoni. However, Pandey was sceptical and didn't wish to tackle such a subject until he met Dhoni himself. It was only after meeting Dhoni personally \u2013 during the second schedule of Baby \u2013 that he was convinced to helm the film. Although, to him, he treated the project not as a biopic, but more as an inspiring story. Pandey admits that he is not a fan of Dhoni and doesn't feel guilty about it. But he does have a predilection for cricket and other renowned cricketers like AB de Villiers and Sachin Tendulkar. He explained how not being a fan helped him direct the movie impartially, \"I think if you are fan, as a director it would be difficult to be objective and impartial. A fan would only see positives. Even negatives will look like positives for him. So not being a fan helped me direct the movie impartially.\" It is the director's first biopic film.Every question that came from the director or any member of the team working on the script was directly answered by Dhoni. He would clear any doubts of the director and Rajput. However, he did not want the film to serve as a whitewash of his life, \"One thing I told (Neeraj) Pandey is that this movie should not be to glorify me. It's about the journey of a professional sportsperson and that's what it should depict.\"\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDirector Pandey, who has not seen any of Sushant Singh Rajput's films, followed his intuition when it came to casting him. Akshay Kumar wanted to play the lead role and wanted Rajput to play the younger MS Dhoni but Rajput was always his (the director's first choice given how both Dhoni and Rajput hail from the same part of India, which made it easy for him to get the dialect right and the fact he has a predilection for sports like Dhoni. When he met Rajput and chatted with him for 15 minutes, he knew that the accent, the setting and the milieu they needed to capture would not be a problem. Rajput admits that he is a fan of Dhoni, and describes himself as an \"ardent\" cricket fan. Rajput's sister is a professional cricketer who once made it to the women's national team, while he himself wasn't very good at the sport no matter how hard he tried, even failing to get selected for the school team.\n\nHe found it difficult to get Dhoni's mannerisms right. He said that he did not pretend to be Dhoni, but actually felt like the cricketer while essaying the title role. In order to prepare for his role, he had to go through an exhaustive prolonged training for a period of 18 months before shooting began and watched his videos for hours, to a point that he subconsciously started picking up some of his traits. For instance, in order to grasp Dhoni's trademark \"Helicopter shot,\" the team would carefully analyse it and fix the bowling machine into one spot and then play the same shot at least 200 to 300 times a day for a week to a point that it came naturally to him. He also met Dhoni thrice before filming commenced. Former wicketkeeper Kiran More personally coached Rajput for thirteen months, including wicket-keeping and batting before he started learning Dhoni's body language. He practiced for four hours, starting at 6:00 every morning. Rajput described More as a \"tough taskmaster,\" who treated him like a professional cricketer rather than an actor. Dhoni's batting style was scientifically analysed, learnt and practised and an analyst was called on board for this. Training sessions were recorded and compared with the cricketer's real game. It took a further six months for Rajput to feel confident that he looked and played like Dhoni.\n\n\n=== Principal photography ===\n\nThe film was shot mainly in authentic and real-life locations where Dhoni spent much of his childhood and teenage years, with Pandey saying that 95% of the locations in the film were authentic. In an effort to stay true to the crux of the biopic, Neeraj also shot scenes from the film in Dhoni's real home in Ranchi, Jharkhand where his parents and brother Narendra currently live. Shooting also took place at Kharagpur railway station where Dhoni once worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE), his old school, Jawahar Vidya Mandir and at the quarter number 142 of Mecon Limited he shared with his four roommates while studying engineering. The filmmakers were also shown his former social hangout as well as introduced to the food he liked eating whilst growing up. Dhoni's real school teacher was cast in the film.Filming also took place in Jamshedpur with shots filmed at Keenan Stadium, and  Aurangabad.Rajput learned Dhoni's signature 'helicopter' shot by the end of the first day, but suffered a hairline fracture and had to leave for two weeks.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nM.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story received the widest release for a Bollywood film receiving a day-and-date release both in India and internationally in a total of 61 countries across approximately 4,500 screens worldwide on the week ending 2 October 2016.However, the film was not released in Pakistan due to problems following the 2016 Uri attack. Sabina Islam, media and marketing manager of the distributor IMGC Global Entertainment in Pakistan told The Express Tribune, \"We wouldn't want to release anything that can aggravate the current situation of the two countries. Dhoni is India's hero so it's risky.\" The film was also not released in Punjabi and Marathi languages. This was because Fox had wanted to release the film on the same day-and-date but a dubbed version in the two aforementioned languages could not be produced at that time.Even though attempts were made later to dub and release the film in the Marathi language in the state of Maharashtra, this was however not possible. This was because Amey Khopkar, chief of Chitrapat Karmachari Sena, the film affairs wing of regional political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena told the filmmakers that releasing the film in the language would cause unfair competition for regional movies by giving rise to a scenario where more filmmakers will release Hindi films dubbed in Marathi, prompting Pandey to scrap the plan.The film was declared tax-free in Uttar Pradesh by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav a day after its release, and in Dhoni's home state, Jharkhand, a few days later. Maharashtra was also declared tax-free on 5 October by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe filmmakers organised large promotions, which later helped the movie register good advance booking. A teaser trailer was released on 15 March 2016, in conjunction with the commencement of the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. The first official poster was released on 7 July 2016, on Dhoni's 35th birthday. In late September 2016, the cast flew to Chennai to promote the film where Dhoni and Rajput met veteran actor Rajinikanth at his residence and discussed the film.Maruti Suzuki released two MS Dhoni inspired special edition of Alto cars \u2013 the Alto 800 and Alto K10 \u2013 as part of the company's association with the film. The two cars were unveiled by Dhoni and R S Kalsi, Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director of Marketing and Sales in Hyderabad on 24 September. As a part of the association, Maruti Suzuki ran a series of customer engagement activities on social media.\nThe film recouped around \u20b9900 million (US$13.5 million) before its release via multiple platforms and ancillary; \u20b9550 million (US$8.2 million) from satellite rights; \u20b9200 million (US$3 million) from endorsement brands; \u20b9100 million (US$1.5 million) for overseas distribution rights; and \u20b950 million (US$750,920) for music rights.Internationally, the film was released in 60 countries across 1,000 screens in conjunction with its Indian premiere. According to Vijay Singh, that marks the biggest-ever release for a Hindi film in Tamil and Telugu and one of the widest for any Indian film internationally. It was released in key markets including the United States and Canada and the U.K. and in the other regular Bollywood diaspora markets in South East Asia, Africa and Europe. Through a chain of distributors the film also went out in non-regular Bollywood territories such as Japan, Spain, France, Hungary, Poland, the Philippines and the West Indies.\n\n\n== Box office ==\n\n\n=== India ===\nThe film was released on Friday, 30 September, across approximately 3,500 screens and delivered an opening of \u20b9213 million (US$3.0 million) on its first day, occupying 45\u201350% of the total marketplace which is the biggest opener of Sushant's career. Buoyed by positive reviews, the film earned a total of \u20b9660 million (US$9.3 million) net the second biggest opening for a Hindi release in 2016 behind Sultan. The Tamil version of the film collected \u20b970 million (US$980,000) in its opening weekend in Tamil Nadu, which is the highest for a film dubbed from Hindi in the state.Following its weekend debut, the film witnessed a sharp fall on Monday earning \u20b985.1 million (US$1.2 million) and \u20b9\u20b975.2 million (US$1.1 million) on Tuesday. By 11 October, the film had grossed a total of \u20b91.16 billion (US$16 million) in India and is currently the fifth highest-grossing Hindi film of 2016 in India.\n\n\n=== International ===\nInternationally, the film made an estimated \u20b9219 million (US$3.1 million) in its opening weekend from 60 countries. It had successful debuts in many markets, including $1.1 million in the U.S., $995,000 in the Middle East, $263,000 in the U.K. where it ranked at No. 9, and $194,000 in Australia for tenth spot. The film received a limited release in the U.S. and Canada across 256 theaters and earned $1,108,650 at an average of $4,331 per theater, debuting at number 14 at the box office, becoming the third Bollywood film of 2016 to debut above $1 million, following Sultan and Fan.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film received mainly positive reviews from critics.The film was noted for omitting certain aspects of Dhoni's life and in the realm of cricket that were deemed noteworthy such as the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 press conference, where Dhoni brought the entire team and read out a statement of unity, the 2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing and betting case and the alleged rift with Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir. The film also does not include Dhoni's take on the two-year ban imposed on Chennai Super Kings from playing in the Twenty20 which he captained at that time, which ultimately led to the Supreme Court asking N. Srinivasan to step aside as BCCI\u2009 President. The film also does not provide any explanation to Dhoni's purchase (and eventual sale) of the 15% stake in the player management firm Rhiti Sports, or why he was named the vice-president of India Cements. While the film featured his sister Jayanti, there was no mention about his real life elder brother, Narendra Singh Dhoni, who is a politician.\nChanchal Bhattacharya, a specialised cricket coach who used to train young cricketers in Dhoni's school campus pinpointed at a pivotal incident during Dhoni's days which was absent in the movie: Dhoni once scored a century for East Zone in a Deodhar Trophy against Central Zone. Karsan Ghavri, who was the coach of East Zone at that time, praised Dhoni's century saying that \"this lad will represent the country one day.\"The Hindu said, \"of course such sanitisation makes the film lose out on interesting layers and complexity, but, curiously, the focused, unwavering eulogising of Dhoni also helps it get an unmistakeable emotional acuity.\" In a more positive take, Andy Bull of The Guardian said that not every aspect of Dhoni's life could be included in the three-hour-and-10-minute-long biopic. He quoted John Briley's famous line from the script he wrote for Richard Attenborough's Gandhi: \"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime.\"Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor gave a positive review of the film, praising the performance of Rajput in particular. Several professional Indian sportsmen and sportswomen such as cricketer Mohammad Kaif, and badminton player Saina Nehwal had high regards for the film.\nRachel Saltz of The New York Times gave a negative review of the film saying that \"you don't have to understand cricket to enjoy a good cricket movie\", e.g. Lagaan (2001), but one does \"have to be a cricket fan, and an indulgent one at that\" for M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. She found the term \"hagiographic\" unfit for the film and labelled the film as \"long and languid.\" She concluded saying \"I learned more about Mr. Dhoni \u2014 his enigmatic character and what marked him as a great captain \u2014 by reading about him after watching this movie than I did during three long hours.\"\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nAmaal Mallik composed the soundtrack for M.S. Dhoni. Rochak Kohli composed one song as a guest composer. T-Series acquired the music rights for the film. The 10 song album features the voices of singers Armaan Malik, Arijit Singh, Siddharth Basrur, Rochak Kohli and Palak Muchhal; it was released in three different language versions: Tamil, Telugu and Marathi. Tamil lyrics were penned by P. Vijay, Telugu by Chaitanya Prasad and Marathi by Guru Thakur. The background music was composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story at IMDb\nM.S.

        "article": "In 1870, Irish Australian artist William Handcock completed a portrait of Tom Wills, Australia's pre-eminent cricketer of the mid-19th century and one of the key founders of Australian rules football. It is unknown who commissioned the work or where it was kept after completion, but in 1923 it was acquired by the Melbourne Cricket Club through its then-secretary, Test cricket great Hugh Trumble.\nThe Handcock portrait is the best-known painting of Wills and is currently on display in the National Sports Museum.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTom Wills is recognised as Australia's first multi-sports superstar, for he dominated cricket and was the primary catalyst behind the sport of Australian rules football. Born in 1835 in the British colony of New South Wales and raised in Victoria, Wills was sent to England in 1850 to attend Rugby School, where he became captain of the school cricket team and played a nascent form of rugby football. Returning home in 1856, Wills revolutionised Australian cricket and captained Victoria to repeated victories in intercolonial matches. In 1858 he called for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter. The following year, he assisted in drawing up the laws from which Australian rules football evolved. He is regarded as one of the more complex and intriguing figures in Australian history, given his lifelong engagement with Indigenous Australians and the nature of his downfall.Wills posed for the portrait before the end of 1870. The artist, William Handcock, was born in Ireland and lived for a period in New Zealand before relocating to Melbourne. He died from tongue cancer soon after the portrait's completion.There is no recorded evidence of the portrait until 1923, when The Australasian reported that Test cricket great Hugh Trumble, then secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), purchased the painting (from whom is not stated) and donated it to the MCC.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe portrait is full-length, measuring 42 cm by 32 cm and done in oils, an unusual medium for Handcock. Set at sunset against a backdrop of firs in the outfield of a cricket oval, Wills is shown in his white flannels and the colours of the MCC on his belt and cap. Appearing stately like a \"pasha of the East\", he holds a cricket bat in the manner of a walking cane. According to biographer Greg de Moore, \"he does not look like an athlete, more like a middle-aged lawyer with a liking for a nobbler\". Wills' \"pendulous paunch\" is suggestive of the early stages of physical decline, and his coarsely reddened nose and cheeks allude to years of alcohol abuse. Historian Geoffrey Blainey detects \"a slight air of weariness\" in his blank expression.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe portrait is the most recognisable image of Wills and the most public symbol of his link to the MCC. It has been reproduced as souvenirs, including Christmas cards.The portrait serves as the cover image of the 1987 book Glorious Innings: Treasures from the Melbourne Cricket Club Collection. In his historical novel The Call (1998)\u2014a semi-fictional account of Wills' life\u2014journalist Martin Flanagan opens the final chapter with an imagining into Handcock's encounter with Wills and the circumstances under which the portrait was painted. In 2003, the Melbourne Cricket Ground celebrated its 150th anniversary by commissioning illustrator Robert Ingpen to create a woven tapestry depicting a chronological history of the ground. The figure of Wills\u2014the second to appear, after the MCC's inaugural president\u2014is based on Handcock's portrait. Wills appears two more times: as umpire of the first recorded Australian rules football match in 1858, and as coach of the 1866\u201367 Aboriginal cricket team, the first Australian team to tour England.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCultural depictions of Tom Wills\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBooks\n\nTheses\n\nWebpages"

        "article": "Sidney \"Sid\" Kiel (18 July 1916 \u2013 19 July 2007) was a South African doctor better known for his sporting career. Both a track and field athlete and a cricketer, he represented South Africa as a hurdler at the 1938 British Empire Games (now the Commonwealth Games), having earlier boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics. His cricket career as an opening batsman for Western Province spanned from 1939 to his retirement in 1947.\n\n\n== Early life and athletics career ==\nKiel was born to a Jewish family in Vrede, Orange Free State, but moved to Cape Town at the age of seven following his father's death. He was educated at South African College Schools (SACS) in Newlands, where he was head boy, captain of the cricket and athletics teams, and vice-captain of the rugby team. Kiel first ran for his country at the age of 16, while still at school. Following a 1935 race where he set a South African record for the 110 metres (or 120 yards) hurdles (and was timed within 0.5 seconds of the world record), he was included in the South African delegation for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, but withdrew in opposition to the German regime's antisemitism. At an October 1937 meet in Cape Town, Kiel recorded a personal best, 14.4 seconds, for the 110 metre hurdles. In that event at the 1938 Empire Games in Sydney, he placed fifth with a time of 14.7 seconds, with the gold medallist being another South African, Tom Lavery.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nFinishing his athletics career, Kiel made his first-class cricket debut for Western Province during the 1939\u201340 season. With the Currie Cup suspended at the time, Western Province's season consisted of two sets of three games, played at home in December 1939 and in the coastal cities of Durban, East London, and Port Elizabeth in March 1940. Opening with Pieter van der Bijl on debut against Griqualand West, Kiel recorded a golden duck, bowled by Alfred Waddington. This however was followed by 36 in the second innings, with his next match, against North Eastern Transvaal, yielding a maiden first-class century, 139 not out. Kiel finished his inaugural season for Western Province with 524 runs from six matches, with a second century, 120, coming against Eastern Province in the last game of the season.A graduate of the University of Cape Town's medical school, Kiel joined the South African Medical Corps (a South African Army unit) during World War II, serving in the North African and Italian theatres. His cricket career was thus interrupted, with a game against Transvaal during the 1941\u201342 season being his only first-class match until the war's end. In that match, he came close to carrying his bat in Western Province's second innings, with his captain, Andrew Ralph, declaring at 236/8 when Kiel was undefeated on 128. Kiel managed two games during the 1945\u201346 season, which include a score of 77 against Natal, and played in five out of six Currie Cup games during the 1946\u201347 season (the first edition of the tournament since the 1937\u201338 season). In what was to be his only Currie Cup season he scored 311 runs from 10 innings, including three half-centuries.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nKiel retired from cricket at the age of 30 to further his medical career, interning at Somerset Hospital before establishing a family practice in Sea Point. He died in the suburb in July 2007, aged 91, having had a heart attack earlier in the year (and been confined to a wheelchair for several years). He had married Jean Kramer in 1949, and had a son and a daughter.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlayer profile and statistics at Cricket Archive\nPlayer profile and statistics at ESPNcricinfo"

Harry's elder sister Emily was the first New Zealand woman to graduate in medicine. Harry attended Otago Boys' High School in Dunedin.\nHe married Florence McConnochie in St Stephen's Church in Dunedin on 22 November 1911.\n\n\n== Cricket career ==\nSiedeberg played for the Carisbrook and Albion cricket clubs in Dunedin. \u201cHe has any amount of patience, and he possesses a strong defence,\u201d the Otago Witness declared in 1898.He made his first-class debut for Otago in 1899-00 and played several matches as an opening batsman and occasional slow bowler without distinction until 1902\u201303, when he was Otago's top-scorer in an innings defeat to the touring English team Lord Hawke's XI, making 21 and 52.His next fifty was in the first match of the 1904\u201305 season, when he made 88, the highest score on either side in Otago's innings victory over Wellington. His innings took two and a quarter hours and was marked by powerful driving. It was the highest score by a New Zealand batsman in 1904\u201305. He also top-scored for Otago in their next match, making 40 in a low-scoring loss to Canterbury. He was selected in both of New Zealand's matches against the touring Australians later in the season, but along with all his team-mates he failed with the bat and Australia won easily each time.Siedeberg made his highest first-class score in the first match of the 1905\u201306 season, when he made 28 and 90 in a victory over Canterbury. He batted two and three-quarter hours for his 90, and added now to his powerful driving was a \"stroke he picked up from that master batsman Trumper, swinging at a ball pitched on the off, and getting it away to leg\", which brought him several boundaries. Once again he made the highest score of the match. In March 1906 he made Otago's first century against a touring team when he scored 102 against Melbourne Cricket Club in a three-day non-first-class match.\nHe batted in the middle order from 1906\u201307. He broke the record for the highest score in senior Dunedin cricket in January 1907 when he scored 223 not out. He appeared once for New Zealand against MCC in 1906\u201307, and twice against Australia in 1909\u201310, but with little success. In 1914\u201315 he took 10 wickets in the match (4 for 22 and 6 for 30) as he and Jack Crawford dismissed Southland twice on the third day after the second day had been lost to rain.He played his last matches for Otago in 1921\u201322 at the age of 44.\n\n\n== Other sports ==\nSiedeberg was the New Zealand Billiards Champion in 1916, 1917, 1919 and 1921. He held the world amateur losing hazards record break of 667, and made more breaks of 100 to 600 than any other amateur in the British Empire. He was forced to give up the game when his eyesight weakened. He was later President of the New Zealand Billiards Control Association.He also played soccer and hockey for Otago, played rugby union in Dunedin, and was proficient in gymnastics and athletics. In later years he took up bowls, and in 1926 he was a member of the New Zealand champion four.\n\n\n== Work ==\nSiedeberg worked for the Victoria Insurance Company and the Queensland Insurance Company before establishing his own business as a financial agent.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Otago representative cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHenry Siedeberg at CricketArchive\nHenry Siedeberg at Cricinfo"

        "article": "Azhar is a 2016 Indian Hindi biographical sports drama film directed by Tony D'Souza. The story and is inspired from the life of Indian cricketer and former national team captain Mohammad Azharuddin. The film is produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor for Sony Pictures Networks and features Emraan Hashmi in the titular role. The film was released worldwide on 13 May 2016. The film was a moderate success at the box office as it collected only 568 million gross against the budget of 350 million. The film also drew criticism for its fictionalised interpretation of events.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with Indian cricketer Azhar scoring a century in his 99th test match, but he soon faces allegations of match-fixing as his name has been linked with a London based bookie M.K. Sharma aka Shaun. The Indian cricket board slaps a life-ban on him. Azhar decides to challenge the ban in court with the help of his lawyer friend Reddy.\nThe story shifts back to 1963, when Azhar was born to a comfortable middle-class family in Hyderabad. His grandfather dreamt of Azhar playing 100 tests for Team India and motivates a soft-spoken young Azhar to answer his rivals with his batting skills. Young Azhar goes for an Indian team selection match to Mumbai, where on the match day he receives the bad news of his grandfather's death. Nonetheless, he participates in the match, in accordance with his grandfather's last wish.\nAzhar impresses the selectors, sealing his place in Team India and he soon becomes a national hero by scoring 3 consecutive centuries in his first 3 Test innings. Azhar soon marries Naureen and they both begin a happy married life. After a loss against Pakistan in 1991, the President of Cricket Board calls Azhar for a one-to-one meeting. Azhar initially fears getting dropped from the team, but is surprised when he is offered the position of team Captain. Some senior players like Manoj, Ravi and Navjot, resent Azhar's appointment as Captain, not wishing to take orders from a younger and less experienced player. But Kapil supports and encourages him to focus on his duty.\nWhile playing in an India\u2013Pakistan match, Javed taunts Azhar, telling Azhar his Muslim heritage would be a better fit for the Pakistan team. Azhar leads his team to victory and soon becomes a successful Captain. At the peak of his career, Azhar's personal life takes a twist when he meets a former Miss India and famous Bollywood actress Sangeeta during an advertising film shoot and instantaneously falls in love with her. Sangeeta likes him too but, aware that he is already married, she warns him to stay away from her. Nevertheless, Azhar is infatuated by her beauty and does not listen to her advice. They begin dating but keep their relationship hidden, until it is suddenly exposed by a gossip magazine.\nAzhar has no alternative but to publicly announce his affair with Sangeeta. Heartbroken, Naureen asks him for a divorce and soon Azhar leaves her to marry Sangeeta. During a cricket match against the West Indies, Azhar gets in a spat with team-mate Manoj for a slow run rate in order to complete his century, letting the team lose. Manoj is dropped from the next match and Azhar leads the team to victory. Manoj is humiliated and vows to take revenge. In later years of his career, Azhar, famous for his expensive lifestyle, comes into the eyes of match-fixers. He is soon approached by a London-based bookie M.K Sharma, disguised as a diamond merchant, who later offers him 10 million rupees to under play in a match against Sri Lanka, which Azhar hesitantly accepts.\nIn a parallel story, after the match-fixing scandal, Azhar is now facing nationwide criticism and a prosecutor, Meera, is building up a strong case against him on the basis of sting operations done by Manoj on Ravi, Navjot and several other cricketers. She also uses the report of the inquiry commission set up by the Cricket Board and secretly meets the bookie M. K. Sharma to gather more evidence. Meera also approaches Naureen, asking her to serve as a witness, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Azhar and his lawyer Reddy are struggling to find any proof of innocence as none of his fellow cricketers are ready to help him out.\nAzhar attends a gym-opening ceremony to gain back his old fame in public, but is left insulted by the owner himself. After a long, eight-year legal fight, Reddy finally makes a breakthrough by proving in court that the inquiry commission report is biased, as they were paid by the Cricket Board itself. Reddy even challenges the authenticity of sting operation tapes as none of the witnesses werree under oath and hence can not be treated as truth. Later, Azhar also reveals that he took 10 million rupees from the bookie to keep him away from other team members but later scored a match winning innings and returned all the money to the bookie.\nOn the final day of judgement, both Naureen and Sangeeta attend the court hearing, showing their support for Azhar. Kapil also states in a television interview that he believes Azhar is innocent. In its final verdict, the court lifts the India cricket board ban imposed on Azhar.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nAs early as June 2013, producer Ekta Kapoor had spoken of her plans and signed a contract with cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin to make this film based on certain well known and highly talked about incidents and facts of Azharrudin's life. At that time actors Saif Ali Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, and Ranveer Singh were on her wish list. Azharuddin was quizzical over the film until after he had read a copy of the script presented to him by director D'Souza. Pakistani actress Urwa Hocane was earlier offered the lead female role of Sangeeta Bijlani, however, she refused saying that she didn't want to do bold scenes. The role was later played by Nargis Fakhri, who herself is of Pakistani ethnicity. Actress Nyra Banerjee worked as an assistant director for this film. The sports action was done by stunt director Rob Miller. Prachi Desai was signed to play the role of Naureen, the first wife of Azharuddin and she met her personally to get into the skin of character. Lara Dutta played the role of lawyer Meera.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming started in May 2015. Various scenes for the film have been shot at cricket grounds including Lord's, The Oval, Edgbaston, St Lawrence Ground and County Ground, Derby, as well as other places in the United Kingdom including Harleyford Manor, Virginia Water, Mayfield Lavender Farm, and Windsor.The first schedule of the film was completed in October 2015 in London and the second schedule also completed in Hyderabad.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe film has generated controversy prior to its release over a storyline that absolves the protagonist Mohammad Azharuddin from charges of fixing matches in return of money. M A Ganapathy the former Superintendent of Police in CBI who was the chief investigating officer in the match-fixing case has refuted the movie's clean chit to Azharuddin claiming that his confession is on tape with the CBI. Azharuddin's involvement in match fixing was also accepted by Rakesh Maria, the former head of the Crime Branch and Commissioner of Mumbai Police. In a conversation recorded by the news magazine Tehelka, Maria claims that Azhar had \"a criminal bent of mind\".\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe soundtrack of Azhar has music composed by Amaal Mallik. Pritam and DJ Chetas have composed one song each as guest composers. Lyrics are penned by Kumaar, Manoj Yadav and Rashmi Virag. The background score has been composed by Sandeep Shirodkar. The Album consists of four original songs by Amaal Mallik & Pritam and one recreation by DJ Chetas.\n\n\n=== Production ===\nEarlier, Pritam was supposed to compose music for the complete album but due to health issues, he was not able to follow the deadline. Amaal Mallik was then roped in to compose music for the film. T-Series has acquired the music rights of the film. DJ Chetas recreated the song \"Oye Oye\" from Tridev (1989 film) originally composed by Viju Shah. This song was picturised on Sangeeta Bijlani, who has been portrayed in the film by Nargis Fakhri.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nThe first single, \"Bol Do Na Zara\", sung by Armaan Malik was released on 8 April 2016. Following it, the second Single, \"Itni Si Baat Hain\", sung by Arijit Singh and Antara Mitra, with music by Pritam was released on 15 April 2016. The complete album consisting of 5 tracks was released on 19 April 2016.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAzhar got an average rating 2 out of 5 stars.It collected around 39 crores at the box office.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPaan Singh Tomar\nMary Kom\nM.S.

        "article": "Gregory Lee Molins (born 19 March 1976) is a former Irish cricketer. A left-arm orthodox spinner, he represented the Irish national side between 1996 and 1999, including at the 1997 ICC Trophy.\nMolins is part of a prominent Irish cricketing family, with his older brother, Jason, and cousin, Lara, also representing Ireland internationally. He was born in Dublin, and attended The High School there, playing for the school team. He first came to prominence at the 1993 under-18 interprovincial tournament, taking three five-wicket hauls for Leinster to be named player of the tournament. Molins made his senior interprovincial debut in 1994, and the following year debuted for the Irish under-19 team. His first senior match for Ireland came in a friendly against Wales in June 1996. Later in the year, in August, he made his first-class debut, in what was then the annual fixture against Scotland.At the 1997 ICC Trophy, Molins played in three of Ireland's matches, against Gibraltar, the United States, and Kenya, but took only two wickets. His 1997 season also included limited-overs games for Ireland in two English competitions (the Benson & Hedges Cup and the NatWest Trophy), and also in the Triple Crown Tournament. Molins' last capped game for Ireland came in 1999, when he was only 23. He continued playing interprovincial matches into the 2000s and Leinster Senior League matches into the 2010s, and toured Namibia with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 2001. In 2008, Molins and his brother, both of Jewish extraction, were selected for an Israeli composite side which played against India A to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence. The team also included various other Jewish players from around the world (including Adam Bacher, Steven Herzberg, Michael Klinger, and Bensiyon Songavkar), and two non-Jewish guest players (Roland Lefebvre and Jonty Rhodes). In April 2015, Molins was appointed a selector for the Irish national team.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreg Molins at Cricket Archive\nGreg Molins at ESPNcricinfo"

Playing school cricket for Wesley College and club cricket for Railway Union, she made her under-23 debut for Ireland at the age of 16, at the 1996 European Under-23 Championship. Molins made her ODI debut for Ireland in June 1999, in a one-off game played while India were touring England. She was one of two debutants for Ireland in the match, the other being Isobel Joyce. Molins went wicketless, as did every other Irish bowler, as the two Indian opening batsmen (Reshma Gandhi and Mithali Raj) both scored unbeaten centuries. She was next selected for an ODI in July 2000, when Pakistan toured to play five ODIs and a single Test (to date, Ireland's only Test against any country). Her sole match in that series was the third ODI, when she took 2/34 from 10 overs to help Ireland win by 150 runs.At the 2000 World Cup, played in New Zealand in December 2000, Molins once again played only a single match, against Australia in Christchurch. She had no opportunity to bowl, as Australia required only 20 overs to chase down Ireland's target of 90. Her next ODI was also against Australia, in Dublin in July 2001, and she again did not bowl, as the match was interrupted by rain. The following month, Molins appeared at the 2001 European Championship, playing in matches against England, the Netherlands, and Scotland. She took four wickets while conceding just 15 runs, and consequently led the tournament's bowling averages. Her best figures came against England (in what was to be her final ODI), when she took 2/5 from two overs to help bowl out England for only 60 (at the time its lowest ODI total). Earlier in the tournament, against Scotland, Molins had taken the remarkable figures of 1/0 from five overs, bowling 30 balls without conceding a run. Only New Zealand's Debbie Hockley has bowled more overs without conceding a run (six, against Ireland in 1988).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLara Molins at Cricket Archive\nLara Molins at ESPNcricinfo"

The shooting of his last film, Pakeezah, was held up for many years due to marital and personal problems between the film producer Kamal Amrohi and the film's lead actress Meena Kumari, and the film was finally released only after Ghulam Mohammed's death.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nGhulam Mohammed was born in Bikaner, Rajasthan, into a family of musicians. His father, Nabi Baksh, was an accomplished tabla player himself.He started his career as a child actor at age six with the Punjab-based New Albert Theatrical Company and worked at local Albert Theatre in Bikaner. \"He eventually signed on as a contract artiste for 25 rupees a month, but before he could take up the appointment, the theatre closed due to financial difficulties.\"\nIn 1924, he came to Bombay, where after a struggle of eight years, in 1932 he got the chance of playing tabla in Saroj Movietone's Productions' \"Raja Bharthari\".In music composition, he first became an assistant, to noted music director, Naushad in Kardar Productions, and worked with him and the veteran film composer Anil Biswas, for over 12 years, before composing music independently, in the film 'Tiger Queen' (1947). He went on to give music in many memorable films and even won the 1955 National Film Award for Best Music Direction for his film Mirza Ghalib (1954). His musical score for film Pakeezah is still considered to be one of the all-time great music scores in Indian Cinema.He died on 17 March 1968, much before his magnum opus, Pakeezah (1972) was released. In fact, his mentor and close friend veteran film composer Naushad stepped in, after his death, to finish the film composing work in film Pakeezah. \"The music by the late Ghulam Mohammed was also a benchmark score. Arriving bang in the midst of the peak era of R. D. Burman and Kishore Kumar, it brought back classic melody of the timeless kind and won a Gold Disc from Saregama, which was then called HMV, for outstanding sales.\" He was also nominated for Best Music Director for film Pakeezah (1972) at the Filmfare Awards. \"In 1972, Pran refused to accept his Filmfare award for the Best Supporting Actor in Be-Imaan because he felt music composer Ghulam Mohammed deserved a Filmfare award for his songs in Pakeezah.\"In 1997, he was honoured, in the 'Keep Alive' music show series in Mumbai, that honours all-time film music composers of India.An extensive audio - visual programme on Ghulam Mohammed was presented by Mumbai- based music troupe MUSICOLOR in 2010 where music lovers cherished the composer's gems.\n\"One commonly-heard story is that when Shankar-Jaikishan were composing their maiden venture Barsaat (1949), they insisted on having Ghulam Mohammed play the dholak for the film song 'Barsaat Mein Ham Se Mile Tum Sajjan'\".\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\n1955: National Film Award for Best Music Direction: Mirza Ghalib (1954)\nHMV Saregama Gold Disc Award in 1972\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGhulam Mohammed at IMDb\nSongs of Ghulam Mohammed"

        "article": "Cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills is the subject of a growing body of works in art and popular culture.\n\n\n== Visual arts ==\nPainted by William Handcock in 1870, a full-length portrait of Wills in his cricket flannels is held at the National Sports Museum. Another painting of Wills wearing a football guernsey is in possession of the Geelong Football Club and held at Kardinia Park.\nA monument to Wills was erected at Moyston in 1998. In 1988, the Melbourne Cricket Club erected bronze doors, designed by Robert Ingpen, outside the club's entrance, depicting Wills holding a football. A statue of Wills umpiring an 1858 football match was erected outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2002. \nWills is the subject of a series of paintings by Archibald Prize nominee Martin Tighe.\n\n\n== Literature ==\nMartin Flanagan's 1998 historical novel The Call is a semi-fictional account of Wills' life. In it, Wills is cast as a tragic sporting genius, and the dingo is used to symbolise his identity as an \"ambiguous creature\" caught between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia. In The Paddock That Grew, released that same year, Keith Dunstan imagines Wills as a ghost touring modern Melbourne.\n\n\n== Music ==\nWills has inspired numerous songs including \"Tom Wills\" (2002) by Mick Thomas of Weddings Parties Anything fame; \"Tom Wills Would\" (2004) by the Warumpi Band's Neil Murray; \"The Ten Rules\" (2010) by folk rock band The Holy Sea; and \"Tom Wills\" by Goanna frontman Shane Howard, written and performed exclusively for The Marngrook Footy Show.\n\n\n== Film and television ==\nPlans for a feature film about Wills were made in 1989 but later abandoned.\nA docudrama on Wills' life, shot in 2008, had its premier at the Arts Centre Melbourne in 2014, and was subsequently shown on Australian television. Portions of the docudrama also form part of an exhibit on Wills' life at the International Cricket Hall of Fame. Wills is portrayed by Nathan Phillips.Wills and the origins of Australian rules football are the subject of an episode of Australia: The Story of Us (2015), produced by Yahoo!7.\n\n\n== Theatre ==\nIn 2004, Bruce Myles adapted Flanagan's novel The Call into a play of the same name for the Malthouse Theatre.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Quotations related to Tom Wills at Wikiquote\n Media related to Tom Wills at Wikimedia Commons"

A right-handed batsman, she has appeared in five of the eight One Day International (ODI) matches that Scotland has played to date.\nDrummond was born in Meigle, a rural village in Perthshire, and played her early cricket for Meigle Cricket Club. Her older brother, Gordon Drummond, later captained the national men's team. Drummond herself made her senior debut for Scotland at the age of 17, appearing in matches against Durham (an English county team) and Wales during the 2002 season. Her first international tournament at a senior level was the 2003 IWCC Trophy in the Netherlands, where matches held ODI status. The second-youngest member of the squad, behind only Fiona Urquhart, Drummond played in all five of her team's matches. However, she scored only nine runs from five innings, which included ducks against Ireland and the Netherlands.The 2003 IWCC Trophy is Scotland's most recent ODI tournament to date, with Drummond being only one of 17 women to have played at that level. Her next international tournament was the 2005 European Championship in Wales, where she was Scotland's equal leading runscorer with Kari Anderson. After that tournament, Drummond took a break from international cricket for several years, not appearing again until the 2014 European Championship in England. She played for Scotland in English domestic competitions in 2014 and 2015, and has also been selected in the national squad for the 2015 World Twenty Qualifier.Drummond married fellow Scotland cricketer Abbi Aitken in June 2019.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnnette Drummond at CricketArchive\nAnnette Drummond at ESPNcricinfo"

The film begins with Sachin tricking his friend to fall in a bore. Sachin narrates about his early childhood that he developed an interest in Cricket after India's 1983 triumph. He used to learn cricket from his coach R. Achrekar. Due to accommodations, he shifted to his aunt's house close to the park. Sachin rose to fame after he made a 664-run partnership with Vinod Kambli. He grew up practicing cricket daily until he was signed by Yorkshire.\nThere is a narration of Indo-Pak rivalry after which Sachin makes his international debut against Pakistan where he performed well. He was picked in the squad for the 1992 Cricket World Cup where India didn't have a great run. Later on, Sachin started rising up the charts.\nThe scene cuts back to Sachin and his wife Anjali walking in a park. Sachin tells about how he met her and later on they married. The film follows Sachin developing glory towards the start of 1996 World Cup. During its semifinal, India was eliminated despite Sachin's best performance.\nUnfortunately Sachin's father died in 1999 before the start of 1999 World Cup. He played in depression though he performed well despite India not reaching the finals. He was praised for his courage and brilliance. Following that, the film shows in detail the darkest phase of Indian cricket. After that, BCCI devised a new team with new players. Tendulkar was made captain two times, having resigned both after facing pressure. He improved his performance by every match. After that, Sachin went on to become the poster boy of the country. He started featuring in most of the TV ads. Mark Mascarenhas also became Sachin's agent. Sachin transformed as the biggest celebrity in India at that time.\nThe film shows Sachin's rivalry with fellow cricketers transforming into friendship.

The screen cuts back to Sachin with his son Arjun in England. Arjun was born 2 weeks after Sachin's father's death. Sachin practises with his son and aspires to make him a cricketer. He has always focused on his abilities due to which Arjun has entered the limelight. Every incident with Sachin results in India bestowing glory.\nThe film shows the events before the 2007 World Cup. The whole team seems to be dissuaded with coach Greg Chappell's advise. Their faith was crushed due to his discrimination policies. As a result, India was eliminated early in the journey by Sri Lanka. The team removed the coach and appointed Gary Kirsten as their coach.\nA depressed Sachin is encouraged by his brother Ajit, to win the World Cup once and for all. Seeming maybe his last chance, he began to prepare everything before the 2011 Cricket World Cup being held in his country and the final in his own city. He eventually became the all-time Test run scorer. The film cuts back to his present life. Sachin tells that whenever he is upset, he always hangs out with his childhood friends. Clips are shown of their enjoyment. He deems them an important part of his life.\nIndia eventually reaches the final of the world cup after 2 brilliant centuries from Sachin in group stages. Sachin gets out on a brittle 18 seeming his last World Cup innings. But strong partnerships and decisive innings by Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni get India back in the match. Dhoni seals the world cup with a six as Sachin finally achieves his lifelong dream. The nation goes berserk and everyone dedicates the victory to Sachin's 24-year hard work for his country. Later on, Sachin scores his 100th century against Bangladesh, an impossible milestone.\nSachin eventually plays his last Test match in 2013 wherein after scoring 74, he gives an emotional speech and thanks everyone who helped him by his way towards glory. He cries and bids farewell to the pitch. After achieving everything he wanted in his life, a proud Sachin walks by the beach thanking God.\nIn a video after the credits, though equally loving each member of his family, Sachin's father expresses that Sachin is and will be special for him forever.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on 26 May 2017 in India.

        "article": "Thomas Clement Douglas  (20 October 1904 \u2013 24 February 1986) was a Canadian politician who served as seventh premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961 and Leader of the New Democratic Party from 1961 to 1971. A Baptist minister, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1935 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). He left federal politics to become Leader of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and then the seventh Premier of Saskatchewan. His cabinet was the first democratic socialist government in North America and it introduced the continent's first single-payer, universal health care program.\nAfter setting up Saskatchewan's universal healthcare program, Douglas stepped down and ran to lead the newly formed federal New Democratic Party (NDP), the successor party of the national CCF. He was elected as its first federal leader in 1961. Although Douglas never led the party to government, through much of his tenure the party held the balance of power in the House of Commons. He was noted as being the main opposition to the imposition of the War Measures Act during the 1970 October Crisis. He resigned as leader the next year, but remained as a Member of Parliament until 1979.\nDouglas was awarded many honorary degrees, and a foundation was named for him and his political mentor M. J. Coldwell in 1971. In 1981, he was invested into the Order of Canada, and he became a member of Canada's Privy Council in 1984, two years before his death. In 2004, a CBC Television program named Tommy Douglas \"The Greatest Canadian\", based on a Canada-wide, viewer-supported survey.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThomas Clement Douglas was born in 1904 in Camelon, Falkirk, Scotland, the son of Annie (n\u00e9e Clement) and Thomas Douglas, an iron moulder who fought in the Boer War. In 1910, his family immigrated to Canada, where they settled in Winnipeg. Shortly before he left Scotland, Douglas fell and injured his right knee. Osteomyelitis set in and he underwent a number of operations in Scotland in an attempt to cure the condition. Later in Winnipeg, the osteomyelitis flared up again, and Douglas was sent to hospital. Doctors there told his parents his leg would have to be amputated; however, a well-known orthopedic surgeon took interest and agreed to treat him for free if his parents allowed medical students to observe. After several operations, Douglas's leg was saved. This experience convinced him that health care should be free to all. Many years later, Douglas told an interviewer: \"I felt that no boy should have to depend either for his leg or his life upon the ability of his parents to raise enough money to bring a first-class surgeon to his bedside.\"During World War I, the family went back to Glasgow. They returned to Winnipeg in late 1918, in time for Douglas to witness the Winnipeg general strike. From a rooftop vantage point on Main Street, he witnessed the police charging the strikers with clubs and guns, and a streetcar being overturned and set on fire. He also witnessed the RCMP shoot and kill one of the workers. This incident influenced Douglas later in life by cementing his commitment to protect fundamental freedoms in a Bill of Rights when he was Premier of Saskatchewan.In 1920, at the age of 15, Douglas began an amateur career in boxing at the One Big Union gym in Winnipeg. Weighing 135 pounds (61 kg), Douglas fought in 1922 for the Lightweight Championship of Manitoba, and won the title after a six-round fight. Douglas sustained a broken nose, a loss of some teeth, and a strained hand and thumb. He held the title the following year.In 1930, Douglas married Irma Dempsey, a music student at Brandon College. They had one daughter, actress Shirley Douglas, and they later adopted a second daughter, Joan, who became a nurse. Actor Kiefer Sutherland, son of daughter Shirley and actor Donald Sutherland, is his grandson.\n\n\n== Education ==\nDouglas started elementary school in Winnipeg. He completed his elementary education after returning to Glasgow. He worked as a soap boy in a barber shop, rubbing lather into tough whiskers, then dropped out of high school at 13 after landing a job in a cork factory. The owner offered to pay Douglas's way through night school so that he could learn Portuguese and Spanish, languages that would enable him to become a cork buyer. However, the family returned to Winnipeg when the war ended and Douglas entered the printing trades. He served a five-year apprenticeship and worked as a Linotype operator finally acquiring his journeyman's papers, but decided to return to school to pursue his ambition to become an ordained minister.\n\n\n=== Brandon University ===\nIn 1924, the 19-year-old Douglas enrolled at Brandon College, a Baptist school affiliated with McMaster University, to finish high school and study theology. During his six years at the college, he was influenced by the Social Gospel movement, which combined Christian principles with social reform. Liberal-minded professors at Brandon encouraged students to question their fundamentalist religious beliefs. Christianity, they suggested, was just as concerned with the pursuit of social justice as it was with the struggle for individual salvation. Douglas took a course in socialism at Brandon and studied Greek philosophy. He came first in his class during his first three years, then competed for gold medals in his last three with a newly arrived student named Stanley Knowles. Both later became ministers of religion and prominent left-wing politicians. Douglas was extremely active in extracurricular activities. Among other things, he became a champion debater, wrote for the school newspaper and participated in student government winning election as Senior Stick, or president of the student body, in his final year.Douglas financed his education at Brandon College by conducting Sunday services at several rural churches for 15 dollars a week. A shortage of ordained clergy forced smaller congregations to rely on student ministers. Douglas reported later that he preached sermons advocating social reform and helping the poor: \"[T]he Bible is like a bull fiddle ... you can play almost any tune you want on it.\" He added that his interest in social and economic questions led him to preach about \"building a society and building institutions that would uplift mankind\". He also earned money delivering entertaining monologues and poetry recitations at church suppers and service club meetings for five dollars a performance. During his second and third years at the college, he preached at a Presbyterian church in Carberry, Manitoba. There he met a farmer's daughter named Irma Dempsey who would later become his wife.\n\n\n=== MA thesis on eugenics ===\nDouglas graduated from Brandon College in 1930, and completed his Master of Arts degree in sociology at McMaster University in 1933. His thesis, entitled The Problems of the Subnormal Family, endorsed eugenics. The thesis proposed a system that would have required couples seeking to marry to be certified as mentally and morally fit. Those deemed to be \"subnormal\", because of low intelligence, moral laxity, or venereal disease would be sent to state farms or camps; while those judged to be mentally defective or incurably diseased would be sterilized.Douglas rarely mentioned his thesis later in his life, and his government never enacted eugenics policies, even though two official reviews of Saskatchewan's mental health system recommended such a program when he became Premier and Minister of Health. As Premier, Douglas opposed the adoption of eugenics laws. By the time Douglas took office in 1944, many people questioned eugenics due to Nazi Germany's embrace of it in its effort to create a \"master race\". Instead, Douglas implemented vocational training for the mentally handicapped and therapy for those suffering from mental disorders.\n\n\n=== PhD research in Chicago ===\nIn the summer of 1931, Douglas continued his studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. He never completed his PhD thesis, but was deeply disturbed by his field work in the Depression-era \"jungles\" or hobo camps where about 75,000 transients sheltered in lean-tos venturing out by day to beg or to steal. Douglas interviewed men who once belonged to the American middle class\u2014despondent bank clerks, lawyers and doctors. Douglas said later: \"There were little soup kitchens run by the Salvation Army and the churches ... In the first half-hour they'd be cleaned out. After that there was nothing ... It was impossible to describe the hopelessness.\" Douglas was equally disturbed that members of the Socialist Party sat around quoting Marx and Lenin, waiting for a revolution while refusing to help the destitute. Douglas said: \"That experience soured me with absolutists ... I've no patience with people who want to sit back and talk about a blueprint for society and do nothing about it.\"\n\n\n== From pulpit to politics ==\nTwo months after Douglas graduated from Brandon College, he married Irma Dempsey and the two moved to the small town of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, where he became an ordained minister at the Calvary Baptist Church. Irma was 19, while Douglas was 25. With the onset of the Depression, Douglas became a social activist in Weyburn, and joined the new Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) political party. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 federal election.During the September 1939 special House of Commons debate on entering the war, Douglas, who had visited Nazi Germany in 1936 and was disgusted by what he saw, supported going to war against Hitler. He was not a pacifist, unlike his party's leader, J. S. Woodsworth, and stated his reasons:\n\nIf you accept the completely absolutist position of the pacifist, then you are saying that you are prepared to allow someone else who has no such scruples to destroy all the values you've built up. This is what I used to argue with Mr. Woodsworth ... if you came to a choice between losing freedom of speech, religion, association, thought, and all the things that make life worth living, and resorting to force, you'd used force. What you have internationally is what you have within a nation. You must have law and order, and you must have the necessary military means to enforce that law and order.\nDouglas and Coldwell's position was eventually adopted by the CCF National Council, but they also did not admonish Woodsworth's pacifist stand, and allowed him to put it forward in the House. Douglas assisted Woodsworth, during his leader's speech, by holding up the pages and turning them for him, even though he disagreed with him. Woodsworth had suffered a stroke earlier in the year and he needed someone to hold his notes, and Douglas still held him in very high regard, and dutifully assisted his leader.After the outbreak of World War II, Douglas enlisted in the wartime Canadian Army. He had volunteered for overseas service when a medical examination turned up his old leg problems. Douglas stayed in Canada and the Grenadiers headed for Hong Kong. If not for that ailment, he would likely have been with the regiment when its members were killed or captured at Hong Kong in December 1941.\n\n\n== Premier of Saskatchewan ==\n\nDespite being a federal Member of Parliament and not yet an MLA, Douglas was elected the leader of the Saskatchewan CCF in 1942 after successfully challenging the incumbent leader, George Hara Williams, but did not resign from the House of Commons until 1 June 1944. He led the CCF to power in the 15 June 1944 provincial election, winning 47 of 52 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, and thus forming the first social democratic government in not only Canada, but all of North America. As premier, Douglas attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.Douglas and the Saskatchewan CCF then went on to win five straight majority victories in all subsequent Saskatchewan provincial elections up to 1960. Most of his government's pioneering innovations came about during its first term, including:\n\nthe creation of the publicly owned Saskatchewan Power Corporation, successor to the Saskatchewan Electrical Power Commission, which began a long program of extending electrical service to isolated farms and villages;\nthe creation of Canada's first publicly owned automotive insurance service, the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office;\nthe creation of a large number of crown corporations, many of which competed with existing private sector interests;\nlegislation that allowed the unionization of the public service;\na program to offer taxpayer-funded hospital care to all citizens\u2014the first in North America.\npassage of the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights, legislation that broke new ground as it protected both fundamental freedoms and equality rights against abuse not only by government actors but also on the part of powerful private institutions and persons. (The Saskatchewan Bill of Rights preceded the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations by 18 months.)Douglas was the first head of any government in Canada to call for a constitutional bill of rights. This he did at a federal-provincial conference in Quebec City in January 1950. No one in attendance at the conference supported him in this. Ten years later, Premier Jean Lesage of Quebec joined with Douglas at a First Ministers' Conference in July 1960 in advocating for a constitutional bill of rights. Thus, respectable momentum was given to the idea that finally came to fruition, on 17 April 1982, with the proclamation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Thanks to a booming postwar economy and the prudent financial management of provincial treasurer Clarence Fines, the Douglas government slowly paid off the huge public debt left by the previous Liberal government, and created a budget surplus for the Saskatchewan government. Coupled with a federal government promise in 1959 to give even more tax money for medical care, this paved the way for Douglas's most notable achievement, the introduction of universal health care legislation in 1961.\n\n\n=== Medicare ===\nDouglas's number one concern was the creation of Medicare. He introduced medical insurance reform in his first term, and gradually moved the province towards universal medicare near the end of his last term. In the summer of 1962, Saskatchewan became the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government, the North American medical establishment, and the province's physicians, who brought things to a halt with the 1962 Saskatchewan doctors' strike. The doctors believed their best interests were not being met and feared a significant loss of income as well as government interference in medical care decisions even though Douglas agreed that his government would pay the going rate for service that doctors charged. The medical establishment claimed that Douglas would import foreign doctors to make his plan work and used racist images to try to scare the public.Douglas is widely known as the father of Medicare, but the Saskatchewan universal program was finally launched by his successor, Woodrow Lloyd, in 1962. Douglas stepped down as premier and as a member of the legislature the previous year, to lead the newly formed federal successor to the CCF, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP).The success of the province's public health care program was not lost on the federal government. Another Saskatchewan politician, newly elected Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, decreed in 1958 that any province seeking to introduce a hospital plan would receive 50 cents on the dollar from the federal government. In 1962, Diefenbaker appointed Justice Emmett Hall\u2014also of Saskatchewan, a noted jurist and Supreme Court Justice\u2014to Chair a Royal Commission on the national health system\u2014the Royal Commission on Health Services. In 1964, Justice Hall recommended a nationwide adoption of Saskatchewan's model of public health insurance. In 1966, the Liberal minority government of Lester B. Pearson created such a program, with the federal government paying 50% of the costs and the provinces the other half. The adoption of public health care across Canada ended up being the work of three men with diverse political ideals \u2013 Douglas of the CCF, Diefenbaker of the Progressive Conservatives, and Pearson of the Liberals.\n\n\n== Federal NDP leader ==\n\n\n=== Election ===\n\nThe 1958 Canadian general election was a disaster for the CCF; its caucus was reduced to eight, and party leader M. J. Coldwell lost his own seat. The CCF executive knew that their party was dying and needed radical change. The executive persuaded Coldwell to remain as leader, but the party also needed a leader in the House of Commons to replace him, because he obviously was no longer a Member of Parliament. The CCF parliamentary caucus chose Hazen Argue as its new leader in the House. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down; this leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party that was being planned by the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. CCF national president David Lewis \u2013 who succeeded Coldwell as president in 1958, when the national chairman and national president positions were merged \u2013 and the rest of the new party's organizers opposed Argue's manoeuvres and wanted Douglas to be the new party's first leader. To prevent their plans from being derailed, Lewis unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party's leadership, and there was a split between the parliamentary caucus and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell stepped down as leader, and Argue replaced him, becoming the party's final national leader.As far back as 1941, Coldwell wanted Douglas to succeed him in leading the National CCF (at that time, it was obvious that Coldwell would be assuming the national leadership in the near future). When the time came for the \"New Party\" to form, in 1961, Coldwell pressured Douglas to run for the leadership. Coldwell did not trust Argue, and many in the CCF leadership thought that he was already having secret meetings with the Liberals with a view to a party merger. Also, Coldwell and Douglas thought Lewis would not be a viable alternative to Argue because Lewis was not likely to defeat Argue; this was partly due to Lewis' lack of a parliamentary seat but also, and likely more importantly, because his role as party disciplinarian over the years had made him many enemies, enough to potentially prevent him from winning the leadership. Douglas, after much consultation with Coldwell, Lewis, and his caucus, decided in June 1961 to reluctantly contest the leadership of the New Party. He handily defeated Argue on 3 August 1961 at the first NDP leadership convention in Ottawa, and became the new party's first leader. Six months later, Argue crossed the floor and became a Liberal.\n\n\n=== House of Commons, Act II ===\nDouglas resigned from provincial politics and sought election to the House of Commons in the riding of Regina City in 1962, but was defeated by Ken More. He was later elected in a by-election in the riding of Burnaby\u2014Coquitlam, British Columbia.Re-elected as MP for that riding in the 1963 and 1965 elections, Douglas lost the redistricted seat of Burnaby\u2014Seymour in the 1968 federal election. He won a seat again in a 1969 by-election in the riding of Nanaimo\u2014Cowichan\u2014The Islands, following the death of Colin Cameron in 1968, and represented it until his retirement from electoral politics in 1979.While the NDP did better in elections than its CCF predecessor, the party did not experience the breakthrough it had hoped for. Despite this, Douglas was greatly respected by party members and Canadians at large as the party wielded considerable influence during Lester Pearson's minority governments in the mid-1960s.\n\n\n=== Views on homosexuality ===\nDuring the 1968 Federal Election, Douglas described homosexuality as a treatable illness by saying \"its a mental illness [and] a psychiatric condition\". Rather than treating it as a criminal offence with imprisonment, Douglas believed it could be treated by psychiatrists and social workers. This view of homosexuality was mainstream at the time, but has since raised questions about how historical figures are remembered.\n\n\n=== The War Measures Act, 1970 ===\nThe October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Douglas and David Lewis\u2014now a Member of Parliament\u2014on the \"hotseat\", with Lewis being the only NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Lewis were opposed to 16 October implementation of the War Measures Act. The act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. During a second vote on 19 October, sixteen of the twenty members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons and four voted with the Liberal government.They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it, dropping to an approval rating of seven per cent in public opinion polls. Lewis, speaking for the party at a press scrum that day: \"The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act.\" Douglas voiced similar criticism: \"The government, I submit, is using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.\"About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield went so far as to say that, \"Quite frankly, I've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time ... I don't brood about it. I'm not proud of it.\"\n\n\n== Late career and retirement ==\nDouglas resigned as NDP leader in 1971, but retained his seat in the House of Commons. Around the same time as the leadership convention held to replace him, he asked the party not to buy him an elaborate parting gift. Instead, he and his friend and political mentor M. J. Coldwell were honoured by the party with the creation of the Douglas\u2013Coldwell Foundation in 1971. He served as the NDP's energy critic under the new leader, David Lewis. He was re-elected in the riding of Nanaimo\u2013Cowichan\u2013The Islands in the 1972 and 1974 elections. He retired from politics in 1979 and served on the board of directors of Husky Oil, an Alberta oil and gas exploration company that had holdings in Saskatchewan.\nIn 1980, Douglas was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree honoris causa by Carleton University in Ottawa. On 22 June 1981, Douglas was appointed to the Order of Canada as a Companion for his service as a political leader, and innovator in public policy. In 1985, he was appointed to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and Brandon University created a students' union building in honour of Douglas and his old friend, Stanley Knowles.In June 1984, Douglas was injured when he was struck by a bus, but he quickly recovered and on his 80th birthday he claimed to The Globe and Mail that he usually walked up to five miles a day. By this point in his life his memory was beginning to slow down and he stopped accepting speaking engagements but remained active in the Douglas\u2013Coldwell Foundation. Later that year, on 30 November, he became a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada.Douglas died of cancer on 24 February 1986, at the age of 81 in Ottawa and was buried at Beechwood Cemetery.In a national TV contest, conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 2004, he was crowned \"Greatest Canadian\" by viewers in an online vote.\n\n\n== Tributes ==\n\nDouglas Provincial Park near Saskatchewan's Lake Diefenbaker and Qu'Appelle River Dam was named after him. The statue The Greatest Canadian, created by Lea Vivot, was erected in his hometown of Weyburn in September 2010 and unveiled by his grandson Kiefer Sutherland. A library located in Burnaby, British Columbia, was named in his honour and had its soft opening on 17 November 2009. Several schools have been named after him, including Tommy Douglas Collegiate in Saskatoon, and a student housing co-op in Toronto, Campus Co-operative Residences, named one of their houses after him as well. The Tommy Douglas Secondary School in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada named in his honour opened in February 2015. Internationally the former National Labor College in Silver Spring, Maryland, was renamed the Tommy Douglas Center after its purchase by the Amalgamated Transit Union in 2014. In March 2019, a plaque commemorating Douglas as the \"Father of Medicare\" was revealed in Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\n\n=== Artistic depiction ===\nIn the two CBC Television mini-series about Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau and Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making, Douglas is portrayed by Eric Peterson. In the biography mini-series, Prairie Giant: The Tommy Douglas Story, which aired on 12 and 13 March 2006, also on CBC, Douglas was played by Michael Therriault. The movie was widely derided by critics as being historically inaccurate. Particularly, the movie's portrayal of James Gardiner, premier of Saskatchewan from the late 1920s to mid-1930s, was objected to by political historians and the Gardiner family itself. In response, the CBC consulted a \"third party historian\" to review the film and pulled it from future broadcasts, including halting all home and educational sales. Prairie Giant was shown in Asia on the Hallmark Channel on 11 and 12 June 2007.Douglas was also the subject of a 1986 National Film Board of Canada documentary Tommy Douglas: Keeper of the Flame, which received the Gemini Award for Best Writing in a Documentary Program or Series. Douglas was mentioned in the Michael Moore documentary Sicko, which compared the health care system in the United States with that of Canada and other countries.\n\n\n== Fables ==\n\"The Cream Separator\" is a fable, written by Douglas, which aims to explain the inherent injustices of the capitalist system as it relates to the agricultural sector by making the analogy that the upper class gets the cream, the middle class gets the whole milk, and the farmers and industrial workers get a watery substance that barely resembles milk.He was also known for his retelling of the fable of \"Mouseland\", which likens the majority of voters to mice, and how they either elect black or white cats as their politicians, but never their own mice: meaning that workers and their general interests were not being served by electing wealthy politicians from the Liberal or Conservative parties (black and white cats), and that only a party from their class (mice), originally the CCF, later the NDP, could serve their interests (mice). Years later, his grandson, television actor Kiefer Sutherland, provided the introduction to a Mouseland animated video that used a Douglas Mouseland speech as its narration.\n\n\n== Honorary degrees ==\nDouglas received honorary degrees from several universities, including\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (LLD) in 1962\nMcMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario (LLD) in May 1969\nQueen's University in Kingston, Ontario (LLD) on 27 May 1972\nUniversity of Regina in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1978\nCarleton University in Ottawa, Ontario (LLD) in 1980\nUniversity of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario (LLD) in June 1980\nUniversity of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, (LLD) 27 May 1981\nTrent University in Peterborough, Ontario (LLD) in 1983\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Archives ==\nThere are Tommy Douglas fonds at Library and Archives Canada and the Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nTommy Douglas and his Government 1944\u20131960\nBiography of Thomas Clement Douglas\nCBC Digital Archives \u2013 Tommy Douglas and the NDP\nOrder of Canada citation\n\nTommy Douglas \u2013 Parliament of Canada biography\nTommy Douglas at Find a Grave\nEncyclopedia of Saskatchewan\nDouglas Provincial Park"

        "article": "Yeshwant Sidhaye (10 April 1932 \u2013 24 November 2002), better known as Baba Sidhaye, was an Indian first-class cricketer who played for Maharashtra, Bombay and Railways. A deaf and mute cricketer, Sidhaye is recognized by the Limca Book of Records for his efforts. He is regarded as the \"first deaf and mute cricketer to have taken the field\" and one of the best fielders in India during his playing career.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSidhaye was born on 10 April 1932 and hails from a village called Konshi near Sawantwadi in Maharashtra. He was deaf and mute by birth. He later moved to Pune to play cricket.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSidhaye made his first-class debut for Maharashtra at the age of 20 and went on to appear in 51 matches. He played most of his cricket for Maharashtra and Railways, and made a few appearances for Bombay, Indian Universities and West Zone. His only first-class hundred of 135 runs came while playing for Maharashtra against Baroda at the 1956\u201357 Ranji Trophy during which he shared a 238-run partnership with captain Bapu Nadkarni. Although Sidhaye did not play international cricket, he appeared in first-class matches against the visiting New Zealand, West Indian, Australian and Ceylonese teams during various points of his career.Sidhaye also played for the Hindu Gymkhana in the Kanga League and, in 1972, hit a 59-minute century in a match, which was then a world record.Sidhaye also coached cricketers after his playing career. He was the coach of the Bombay Cricket Association and is said to have trained over 50 first-class cricketers. He spotted Balwinder Sandhu at a summer coaching camp and trained him, before Sandhu went on to play for India.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nSidhaye was as a hard-hitting middle-order batsman and part-time leg spinner. He was known as an agile fielder in the covers and earned the nickname \"Panther\" due to his swift movement while fielding. Bapu Nadkarni, who was the captain of Sidhaye at Maharashtra and Hindu Gymkhana, recalls, \"He was a wonderfully gifted player. Under my captaincy, he scored three centuries, each one being a gem. And what a fielder! He and Ravi Bhadbhade in the covers were simply brilliant. Getting the ball past them was impossible. Baba enjoyed his cricket and didn't bother about anything.\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSidhaye and his wife Pramodini Sidhaye had a son and two daughters; their son Pravin Sidhaye also played cricket. Baba Sidhaye died on 24 November 2002 after a prolonged illness.\nIn 2011, Sidhaye was recognized by the Limca Book of Records for having \"excelled in the field of cricket\" despite being \"differently-abled\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nIqbal, an Indian film about a deaf and mute boy who aspires to be a cricketer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBaba Sidhaye at ESPNcricinfo\nBaba Sidhaye at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

He subsequently played twenty first-class matches for New South Wales between 1879-80 and 1893-94.A batsman and occasional wicket-keeper, Joe Davis' highest first-class score was for New South Wales against Ivo Bligh's XI in 1882-83, when, opening the batting, he scored 85 in the second innings out of a team total of 165. He dropped out of the New South Wales team for interstate matches after the 1887-88 season, but he returned to captain the team on tours of New Zealand, in 1889-90 and 1893-94, both tours having been organised and managed by Davis' older brother, Coleman.Davis was a jeweller. He married Phoebe Davis in Sydney in February 1885.He collapsed while playing bowls in May 1911 and died at home early the next morning, aged 52. He left a widow, a son and three daughters. He was buried in the Jewish section of Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney. He is sometimes called \"Jonas J. Davis\", but his probate notice refers to him as \"JONAS DAVIS commonly known as Joseph Davis\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of New South Wales representative cricketers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJonas Davis at ESPNcricinfo"

        "article": "Emma Michelle Kearney (born 24 September 1989) is an Australian rules footballer and cricketer. She plays for and captains the North Melbourne Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW) and plays for the Melbourne Stars in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nKearney was born in the Victorian town of Hamilton, and raised on a sheep station in nearby Cavendish. She played football through her early years, but was forced to give up the sport at the age of twelve, when she was barred from playing with the youth boys team.\nShe attended high school at Monivae College in Hamilton.\n\n\n== Australian rules football ==\n\n\n=== State league and representative football ===\nKearney returned to football while studying a physical education teaching degree at university in Ballarat.She began playing state-league football in 2010, when she joined Melbourne University in the Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL). She won the club best and fairest award in 2012 and 2013. In 2016, she was a member of the club's grand final side that ultimately lost to the Darebin Falcons.In 2013, she was selected to play in, and was a member of the winning Victorian side at the AFL Women's National Championship in Cairns.Kearney was selected by the Western Bulldogs with the tenth overall pick in the first women's AFL draft in 2013. Kearney then played in the inaugural women's exhibition match in June that year. She would go on to play in exhibition matches for the club through to the end of 2016.\n\n\n=== AFL Women's career ===\nKearney was signed by the Western Bulldogs as a priority player in August 2016. As part of the newly formed league's rules, her off-field work at the club made her eligible for the special pre-draft signing.Kearney faced a limited pre-season, missing eight training sessions due to cricketing commitments across the 2016-2017 summer.She made her league debut in the club's inaugural match, in round one of the 2017 season against Fremantle at VU Whitten Oval. She was among the best afield, recording a game-high twenty-three disposals on the night. At the conclusion of round 2, Kearney was ranked first in the competition for disposals, uncontested possessions, inside-50s and metres gained. She was also ranked second in clearances. In Round 6 she recorded 30 disposals, becoming the first player to reach the total in the competition's six week history. After six rounds Kearney remained amongst the most prolific ball-winning midfielders in the competition; ranking second for total disposals and first for both inside-50s and metres gained.At the end of the 2017 season, Kearney was nominated by her teammates for the AFL Players' Most Valuable Player Award and was listed in the All-Australian team.In May 2017 she was announced as the co-winner of the Susan Alberti award, as the equal best and fairest player at the club alongside Ellie Blackburn.The Western Bulldogs signed Kearney for the 2018 season during the trade period in May, 2017. The Western Bulldogs won the premiership by defeating Brisbane at the 2018 AFL Women's Grand Final, and Kearney was named the 2018 AFL Women's best and fairest on 27 March 2018.On 4 April 2018, Kearney informed the Bulldogs that she had accepted employment as sport and recreation coordinator at The Huddle, North Melbourne's community organization, and that she would accept a contract to play with North Melbourne during the 2019 AFL Women's season. In November 2018, North Melbourne announced Kearney as inaugural captain of the team.The 2020 AFL Women's season saw Kkarney obtain her fourth AFL Women's All-Australian team selection, named in the full back position.\n\n\n== Cricket ==\nIn January 2014, Kearney represented Victoria in the women's under-17 national championships in Geelong. She played five matches for the tournament, taking a single wicket.Kearney later played grade cricket at the Essendon Maribyrnong Park Ladies Cricket Club in Melbourne's inner-north.She was selected for the Victorian Spirit in the 2013/14 season for the first time. There she played first class Twenty-20 and limited overs matches. She has continued to play limited overs cricket with Victoria through to the end of the 2016/17 season.\nKearney was signed by the Melbourne Stars ahead of the league's inaugural season in 2016/17.\nIn her first season at the club, she took seven wickets from twelve matches. She was the club's most economic fast bowler and third tidiest overall. Kearney took eight wickets in fourteen matches in 2016/17 and at a club's best economy of 5.27 runs per over.\n\n\n=== Dual sports controversy ===\nKearney garnered media attention in December 2016 on account of her dual-sports status. She revealed that she had been asked by Cricket Australia to sign documents committing her to prioritise cricket training and matches over AFL Women's training sessions held during the cricket season. At the time, Kearney voiced public criticism of the decision by cricket bosses in light of the semi-professional nature of the league.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOutside of cricket and football, Kearney has worked as a physical education teacher including at Mount Alexander College in Flemington. She holds a bachelor of physical education from Ballarat University.Kearney's partner is fellow AFLW player Kate Shierlaw, who captains St Kilda.\n\n\n== AFL Women's statistics ==\nStatistics are correct to the end of the 2021 season.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEmma Kearney's profile on the official website of the North Melbourne Football Club\nEmma Kearney at AustralianFootball.com"

        "article": "Erin Alexandra Burns (born 22 June 1988) is an Australian cricketer who plays as a right-handed batter and right-arm off break bowler. She has appeared in one One Day Internationals and five Twenty20 Internationals for Australia, making her debut in September 2019 against the West Indies. She plays for New South Wales in the Women's National Cricket League, Sydney Sixers in the Women's Big Bash League and Birmingham Phoenix in The Hundred. She has previously played for Tasmania, Wellington, Hobart Hurricanes and Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Wollongong, Burns found herself unable to progress any further through the strong New South Wales system than the state's second XI.  In 2009, however, the Tasmanian Roar was casting around for extra talent for its entry to interstate competition, and rang Burns with an offer of a place which she accepted.\n\n\n== Tasmanian Roar ==\nBurns won the Tasmanian Roar Player of the Year award for 2009\u201310. She was a squad member of the Southern Stars in 2011, and toured New Zealand with the Shooting Stars in 2012.  She remained part of the Shooting Stars squad, and was once again Tasmanian Roar Player of the Year, in 2012\u201313.  In that season's Australian Women's Twenty20 Cup, she played such a prominent role for the Roar, including by hitting 90 runs against Victorian Spirit off just 50 deliveries, with 10 boundaries and four sixes, that she was named the ACA women's Player of the Month for December 2012.In late 2013, Burns suffered a serious cartilage tear in her knee that threatened her playing career.  However, Sydney Swans club doctor Nathan Gibbs treated the injury with stem cell injections, which were more effective than anticipated;  Burns returned to the Roar at a T20 match in November 2014.In October 2016, during the opening round of that season's WNCL, Burns top scored for the Roar in the match against the South Australian Scorpions with 45 runs, and also took two wickets.\n\n\n== Hobart Hurricanes ==\nBurns was included in the Hurricanes squad for its inaugural WBBL|01 season (2015\u201316), during which she scored 224 runs at 17.23 with a highest score of 34, and took 7 wickets at 30.14 with best figures of 2/22.  She also achieved the feat of taking three catches in a single innings.During the WBBL|02 season (2016\u201317), Burns played a key role in two Hurricanes wins.  On 18 December 2016, she hit a four through mid-wicket off the final ball of a super over to claim victory against the Melbourne Renegades, and propel the Hurricanes to equal first on the WBBL table.  On 5 January 2017, after being promoted to open the Hurricanes' innings against Sydney Thunder, she scored 46 runs, and shared in a second wicket partnership of 64 with Heather Knight, to help lead the Hurricanes to a match winning 171/3, which eventually proved to be the highest innings total for WBBL|02.In November 2018, she was named in the Sydney Sixers' squad for the 2018\u201319 Women's Big Bash League season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn August 2019, Burns was named in Australia's squad for their series against the West Indies. She made her Women's One Day International (WODI) debut for Australia against the West Indies on 8 September 2019. She made her Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) debut for Australia, also against the West Indies, on 14 September 2019.In January 2020, she was named in Australia's squad for the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBurns completed a degree in Exercise Science in 2009, and later, with the assistance of a University of Sydney Elite Athlete Program (EAP) scholarship, obtained a master's degree in Physiotherapy.  She has worked as both an Exercise Physiologist and Physiotherapist, and has a particular interest in sporting injuries.  While undergoing rehabilitation for her knee injury, Burns took up cycling to strengthen her knee.  In 2015, she completed a 1,000 km (620 mi) bike ride from her home town of Wollongong to Melbourne to raise money for Bowel Cancer Australia, in honour of her late father, who died from the disease in 2005.Burns married her wife Anna in 2019, and has supported initiatives to include the LGBTQI community as part of the Sydney Sixers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Erin Burns at Wikimedia Commons\n\nErin Burns at ESPNcricinfo\nErin Burns at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nErin Burns at Cricket Australia"

Maro\u0161 Kolpak had lost his contract with German handball club TSV Ostringen, as his team already had two non-EU players. Kolpak appealed to the European Court of Justice, claiming that he should not be considered as a non-EU player as he was a German resident, and Slovakia was part of the European Union Association Agreement. The court ruled in favour of Kolpak, and allowed citizens of countries that had free trade treaties with the EU, and were part of European Union Association Agreements, to work in any EU country. In March 2004, South African cricketer Claude Henderson became the first player to sign a Kolpak agreement, which ended his international career.\n\n \nThe ruling allowed citizens of around 100 nations to play cricket in any EU nation without being considered as an overseas player. The Cotonou Agreement allows the citizens of most Caribbean and African nations to be eligible for signing Kolpak agreements. However, the British Home Office stipulates that a player must have a valid work permit for four years or must have a specified number of appearances in international cricket to sign a Kolpak deal. Kolpak players older than 18 years can qualify to represent England after playing for seven years for a county and gaining citizenship. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) pays \u00a31,100 less to a county for each County Championship game and \u00a3275 less for each One Day match per Kolpak player who plays instead of a domestic cricketer. This is aimed at reducing the mass arrivals of overseas players into county cricket.Cricketers born in British overseas territories can play county cricket as locals and need not sign Kolpak agreements. For instance, Omari Banks, who has played for the West Indies, was eligible to play for Leicestershire and Somerset as a local player because he is from Anguilla (a British overseas territory).Kolpak deals may not be possible once Britain withdraws from the European Union as part of Brexit.\n\n\n== List of players ==\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "This is a list of cricketers born outside England who have represented England's cricket team at Test, One Day International, or T20I level.\nThe country of birth is the only criterion applied; therefore, some of the players below may have very little relationship with the country of their birth, while others were born and bred in that particular country.\nElsewhere, other England internationals may be associated with a country but are not listed below because they were actually born in England. For example, Matthew Maynard, who is often listed as a Welsh cricketer because of his links with Anglesey\nand Glamorgan, was born in Oldham, Lancashire.\nCountries of birth are listed under their current names and according to their current borders to avoid possible confusion. Therefore, players born in what is now Zimbabwe are listed as such, regardless of whether they were born in Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia or Zimbabwe. Similarly, Neal Radford was born in Luanshya in modern-day Zambia and is therefore listed under that country, although at the time Luanshya was part of the short-lived protectorate of Northern Rhodesia. Finally, Joseph McMaster is listed under Northern Ireland although his birthplace, County Down, was then part of Ireland.\nPlayers born in seven Caribbean nations (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica and St Kitts and Nevis) have played for England. Combining these countries in the tradition of the West Indies cricket team would give a total of 14 players.\nIn recent years, the England team has been perceived to benefit hugely from players born in South Africa. Since Andrew Strauss made his ODI debut in 2003, twelve other South African-born players have played international cricket for England. \nAfter England won the World Cup final in 2019, references were made to the \"diverse\" nature of the team, which included four foreign-born players in the starting eleven: Eoin Morgan, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer.\nAs of 8 July 2021, 111 players born abroad have represented England, of a total of 750 players.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== References =="

He is deaf.\nBhattacharjee made his first-class debut against Orissa in the Ranji Trophy in December 1970. He took 6 for 26 in the first innings as Orissa were dismissed for 81. P. N. Sundaresan, writing in Wisden, described him as \"[playing] the game with great zest and never [sparing] himself whether bowling or fielding\".In the first match of the 1971-72 season he took 3 for 54 and 7 for 10 against Assam, dismissing them for 32 in the second innings, when they batted two men short. In each of his first two seasons Bihar progressed to the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals. He was less successful in 1972-73, which was his last season.\nAlthough he was no longer playing first-class cricket, Bhattacharjee received the Arjuna Award in 1974, thus becoming the first cricketer of Bengali descent to receive the award. He captained the Indian deaf team against Australia in 1978 and 1985 and against Pakistan in 1982. He later served as President of the Asia Deaf Cricket Federation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnjan Bhattacharjee at ESPNcricinfo\nAnjan Bhattacharjee at CricketArchive (subscription required)"

He has been one of the iconic members of the England national blind cricket team since 2000 as he is regarded as one of the most experienced blind cricketers to play for the national blind cricket team. He is a prolific run scorer for England in blind cricket, aggregating more than 3500 runs. Foy also holds the world record for being the leading runscorer in 40-overs blind cricket matches and was considered as a better batsman during his early career. Nathan Foy is often considered a father figure for the younger generation of blind cricket. He is also well known for his ability to convert centuries into double centuries, his ability to construct patient innings, as well as for his accuracy in fielding. He is also the current member of the Warwickshire Visually Impaired cricket team.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNathan Foy was selected to the England blind cricket team for the 2002 Blind Cricket World Cup. In his maiden Blind Cricket World Cup tournament, he blasted 510 runs in only 6 matches including 2 double centuries. He played a memorable innings of 152 in the England's dramatic victory over India at the 2002 Blind Cricket World Cup, which is also the England's only victory against India in blind cricket. In a match against Pakistan, Nathan Foy slammed 232 off just 125 balls which is also his career best score in blind cricket. Despite his heroics with the bat, the English blind cricket team didn't to qualify for the semifinals of the tournament.\nIn 2010, he released himself from the England cricket team as he planned to spend some time with his family members. He also made a comeback to the national team during the 2014 Blind Cricket World Cup.He was also the part of the national team at the 2017 Blind T20 World Cup.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn the 2008 Blind Ashes Test Series, Nathan Foy was accused of having unfair advantage in the field as he was regarded as totally blind cricketer who is classified under B1 category. The Australian cricketers stated that the blind cricketer had a much better eyesight as he paved the way in England's triumph against Australia in the 3 match test series with his double century in England's first innings total and with his extraordinary fielding efforts in the field. Nathan eventually created few clean direct hits with his accuracy in the field which created a huge confusion for the Australian blind cricketers. It was later revealed that the B1 category cricketers would find difficulties in the field especially when they try to make direct hit opportunities in the field.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at CricHQ\nMatch list at PCB"

The film follows the life of Balasaheb Thackeray, the founder of the Indian political party Shiv Sena. The film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Thackeray and Amrita Rao as his wife. The film released on 25 January 2019, right after the 93rd birthday of Bal Thackeray.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is a biopic based on Marathi politician Balasaheb Thackeray.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as Bal Thackeray\nAmrita Rao as Meena Thackeray\nMukund Gosavi as Prabodhankar Thackeray\nSachin A.

The film's score was composed by Amar Mohile.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe official trailer was released on 26 December 2018. Raut has plans to continue the film with a sequel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThackeray received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and states: \"While the honesty is commendable, it comes across that the lead character's political motivations lack clarity. Perhaps a more seasoned writer, could have fleshed out Thackeray's characters and eccentricities a lot better. But, its Nawaz's nonchalant performance that overshadows the flaws and leaves a lasting impact.\"\nTimes Now went with 2.5 stars out of 5 and has to say: \"A lot of focus is put on making the film a tearjerker by emphasizing the aftermath of the riots, violence and fights that pretty much summed up Shiv Sena's history under the guidance of founder, Bal Thackeray. The film is good because of Nawazuddin's performance but it cannot be considered as one of the best biopics ever created.\"\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe life time domestic collection is \u20b9316 million (US$4.4 million) as per Taran Adarsh.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nPopular Tamil and Telugu actor Siddharth has slammed Bal Thackeray for abusing South Indians. \u201cNawazuddin has repeated 'Uthao lungi bajao pungi' (lift the lungi and *'#$ him) in the film #Thackeray. Clearly hate speech against South Indians... In a film glorifying the person who said it! Are you planning to make money out of this propaganda? Stop selling hate! Scary stuff!\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThackeray at IMDb\nThackeray at Bollywood Hungama\nThackeray at Rotten Tomatoes"

        "article": "Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah (5 December 1905 \u2013 8 September 1982) was a Kashmiri politician who played a central role in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. Referred as \"Sher-e-Kashmir\" (Lion of Kashmir), Abdullah was the founding leader of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference (later renamed Jammu and Kashmir National Conference) and the 1st elected Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir after its accession to India. He agitated against the rule of the Maharaja Hari Singh and urged self-rule for Kashmir.He served as the 1st elected Prime Minister of the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir and was later jailed and exiled. He was dismissed from the position of Prime Ministership on 8 August 1953 and Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad was appointed as the new Prime Minister. The expressions 'Sadar-i-Riyasat' and 'Prime Minister' were replaced with the terms 'Governor' and 'Chief Minister' in 1965. Sheikh Abdullah again became the Chief Minister of the state following the 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord and remained in the top slot till his death on 8 September 1982.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSheikh Abdullah was born in Soura, a village on the outskirts of Srinagar, eleven days after the death of his father Sheikh Mohammed Ibrahim. His father had been a middle class manufacturer and trader of Kashmiri shawls.According to Abdullah Sheikh, his step brother mistreated his mother and his early childhood was marked by utter poverty. His mother was keen that her children should receive proper education and, so, as a child, he was first admitted to a traditional school or Maktab where he learnt the recitation of the Quran and some basic Persian texts like Gulistan of Sa'di, Bostan and Padshanama. Then in 1911 he was admitted to a primary school where he studied for about two years.\nHowever, their family barber Mohammed Ramzan prevailed upon his uncle to send him back to school. He had to walk the distance of ten miles to school and back on foot, but in his own words, the joy of being allowed to obtain a school education made it seem a light work. He passed his Matriculation examination from Punjab University in 1922.\n\n\n== Higher studies ==\nAfter matriculation he obtained admission in Shri Pratap College, the leading college of Kashmir. He also went to the Prince of Wales College in Jammu. Then he took admission in Islamia College, Lahore and graduated from there. In 1930, he obtained an M.Sc. in Chemistry from Aligarh Muslim University. During his college days he was an eye witness of the protests of the workers of the Government Silk Factory during the Silk Factory Workers Agitation and the sight of workers agitating for their rights made a deep impression on him and was an important factor in motivating him to struggle for the rights of the people of the Jammu and Kashmir State.\n\n\n== Political activism ==\n\nAs a student at Aligarh Muslim University, he came in contact with and was influenced by persons with liberal and progressive ideas. He became convinced that the feudal system was responsible for the miseries of the Kashmiris and like all progressive nations of the world Kashmir too should have a democratically elected government.\n\n\n=== Reading Room Party ===\nIn the 1920s there were a couple of 'reading rooms' in Srinagar which consisted of the educated youth of the area and could only be formed after acquiring the permission of the government. Forming political associations the time was banned. In 1922, G. A. Ashai set up the Islamia School Old Boys Association (a reading room) with 20 members as part of the leadership, including Sheikh Abdullah. At this time Abdullah was still in college.Permission to open the Fateh Kadal Reading Room Party was given in 1930 and Sheikh Abdullah became the Secretary of the party. During Abdullah's time the reading room party was located in the house of Mufti Ziauddin. For Abdullah, \"the establishment of reading room(s) was an excuse\"; rather it was an opportunity to get together to discuss different issues.One of the first incidents which led Abdullah's Reading Room Party to gain wider recognition was after writing a letter to the government related to government recruitment policies. Subsequently they were called to present their views in front of the Regency Council headed by G. E. C. Wakefield in October 1930. This was one of the first interactions of Sheikh Abdullah with the government and the favourable impression that Abdullah had left on Wakefield helped push his name into the public limelight.\n\n\n=== Muslim Conference ===\nSheikh Abdullah and his colleagues were greatly influenced by the lectures of a Kashmiri polymath and lawyer Molvi Abdullah.\nMolvi Abdullah's son Molvi Abdul Rahim, Sheikh Abdullah and Ghulam Nabi Gilkar were the first three educated Kashmiri youth to be arrested during the public agitation of 1931.\n\nKashmir's first political party the Kashmir Muslim Conference with Sheikh Abdullah as President, Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas as general secretary, and Molvi Abdul Rahim as Secretary was formed on 16 October 1932. In his presidential address Sheikh Abdullah  categorically stated that the Muslim Conference had come into existence to struggle for the rights of all oppressed sections of the society and not Muslims alone. It was not a communal party and would struggle for the rights of the oppressed, whether Hindu, Muslim or Sikh, with the same fervor. He reasserted that the struggle of Kashmiris was not a communal struggle.In March 1933 the Muslim Conference constituted a committee which included Molvi Abdullah and nine other members for the purpose of establishing contacts with non-Muslim parties and exploring the possibility of forming a joint organisation. Those nine members were Khwaja Saad-ud-din Shawl, Khwaja Hassan Shah Naqshbandi, Mirwaiz Kashmir, Molvi Ahmad-Ullah, Mirwaiz Hamadani, Agha Syed Hussain Shah Jalali, Mufti Sharif-ud-din, Molvi Atiq-Ullah and Haji Jafar Khan. According to Abdullah Sheikh this effort was not successful because of the unfavourable reception of the idea by the non-Muslim parties. Sheikh Abdullah campaigned to change the name of the Muslim Conference to National Conference, under the influence of among others Jawaharlal Nehru. After a prolonged and vigorous campaign a special session of the Muslim Conference held in June 1939 voted to change the name of the party to National Conference. Of the 176 members attending the session, 172 members voted in favour of the resolution. According to Sheikh Abdullah the support of Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas of Jammu was very important in motivating the members to vote for this change.\n\n\n=== Electoral politics ===\nAs a result of the 1931 agitation, the Maharajah appointed a Grievances Commission with an Englishman B.J. Glancy as President who submitted its report in March 1932. Subsequently, a Constitutional Reforms Conference also presided over by B.J. Glancy recommended the setting up of an elected Legislative Assembly (Praja Sabha). Consequently, a Praja Sabha with 33 elected and 42 nominated members elected on the basis of separate electorates for Hindus and Muslims was established in 1934. Women and illiterate men without sufficient property, or title, or annual income of less than Rupees four hundred did not have the right to vote. Roughly less than 10% (according to Justice Anand only 3%) of the population were enfranchised.Even after the formation of Praja Sabha in 1934 as recommended by the Commission real power continued to remain in the hands of the Maharajah.Seventeen years later in 1951, the government of Kashmir with Sheikh Abdullah as Prime Minister held elections to a Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Sheikh Abdullah's Government had been accused of rigging in these elections to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was introduced to Jawaharlal Nehru in 1937 and as he too was a leader of the Indian National Congress was demanding similar rights for people of British India and had formed The All India States Peoples Conference for supporting the people of Princely States in their struggle for a representative government the two became friends and political allies.\n\n\n=== National Conference ===\nHe introduced a resolution in the working committee of the Muslim Conference for changing its name to National Conference on 24 June 1938 to allow people from all communities to join the struggle against the autocratic rule of the Maharaja. Meanwhile, he along with his liberal progressive friends, many of whom were not Muslim like Kashyap Bandhu, Jia Lal Kilam, Pandit Sudama Sidha, Prem Nath Bazaz and Sardar Budh Singh drafted the National Demands the forerunner of the famous Naya Kashmir (New Kashmir) Manifesto (which was a charter of demands for granting a democratic constitution committed to the welfare of the common people of Kashmir)He presented these demands to the Maharajah in a speech on 28 August 1938. The Maharajah was not willing to accept these demands and so he along with many of his companions was arrested for defying prohibitory orders and sentenced to six months imprisonment and a fine. His arrest provoked a public agitation in which volunteers called Dictators (so called because they had the authority to defy laws that was forbidden for normal law-abiding party members) courted arrest. This agitation was called off on the appeal of Mohandas K. Gandhi. He was released after serving his sentence on 24 February 1939 and accorded a grand reception by the people of Srinagar on his return. Speeches were made at the reception stressing the importance of unity among Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Subsequently the resolution for changing the name of Muslim Conference to National Conference was ratified with an overwhelming majority by the General Council of the Muslim Conference on 11 June 1939 and from that date Muslim Conference became National Conference.\n\n\n=== Quit Kashmir agitation ===\nIn May 1946 Sheikh Abdullah launched the Quit Kashmir agitation against the Maharajah Hari Singh and was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment but was released only sixteen months later on 29 September 1947. According to prominent columnist and writer A. G. Noorani, Quit Kashmir was ill-timed and illogical.\n(See Tehreek e Hurriyat e Kashmir By Rashid Taseer (Urdu) volume 2-page 29 for \"National Demands\" discussion and see Chapter 12-page 310-313 regarding presentation of \"Naya Kashmir\" Manifesto to Maharaja Hari Singh. Full text of \"Naya Kashmir\" manifesto is given from page 314 to 383. English translation of this text is available at Wikisource. Also see relevant chapters from Atish e Chinar regarding 1931 agitation (Chapters 9, 10 and 11) Glancy Commission (Chapter 15) formation of Muslim Conference (Chapter 18) meeting with Nehru (Chapter 23), reasons for change in name of Muslim Conference to National Conference (Chapter 24) and becoming president of All India States Peoples Conference (Chapter 31). His arrest and subsequent release following the Quit Kashmir agitation is discussed in Chapter 34-page 372-389.)\n\n\n== Head of Government ==\n\n\n=== Head of emergency administration ===\n\nMaharaja Hari Singh appealed to Lord Mountbatten of Burma the Governor-General of India for Indian military aid. In his Accession Offer dated 26 October 1947 which accompanied The Instrument of Accession duly signed by him on 26 October 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh wrote \"I may also inform your Excellency's Government that it is my intention at once to set up an interim Government and ask Sheikh Abdullah to carry the responsibilities in this emergency with my Prime Minister.\"Lord Mountbatten accepted the accession after a meeting of the Defence Committee on 26 October 1947. In accepting the accession unconditionally he wrote, \"I do hereby accept this Instrument of Accession. Dated this twenty seventh day of October, nineteen hundred and forty seven\". In the covering letter to Hari Singh, he wrote \"In consistence with their policy that in the case of any State where the issue of accession has been the subject of dispute, the question of accession should be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people of the State, it is my Government's wish that, as soon as law and order have been restored in Kashmir and its soil cleared of the invader, the question of the State's accession should be settled by a reference to the people\". Also in his letter to the Maharaja Lord Mountbatten wrote \"My Government and I note with satisfaction that your Highness has decided to invite Sheikh Abdullah to form an Interim Government to work with your Prime Minister.\" The support of Mahatma Gandhi and Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a key factor in getting Sheikh Abdullah appointed as Head of the emergency administration by the Maharaja.As a consequence, Sheikh Abdullah was appointed head of an emergency administration by an order issued by the Maharaja which was undated except for the mention October 1947 in place of the date. He took charge as Head of the Emergency Administration on 30 October 1947.He raised a force of local Kashmiri volunteers to patrol Srinagar and take control of administration after the flight of the Maharaja along with his family and Prime Minister Meher Chand Mahajan to Jammu even before the Indian troops had landed. This group of volunteers would serve as the nucleus for the subsequent formation of Jammu and Kashmir Militia. This, Sheikh Abdullah hoped, would take over the defence of Kashmir after the Indian army was withdrawn. This was articulated in his letter to Sardar Patel dated 7 October 1948 in which he wrote, \"With the taking over of the State forces by the Indian Government, it was agreed that steps would be taken to reorganise and rebuild our army so that when the present emergency is over and the Indian forces are withdrawn the State will be left with a proper organised army of its own to fall back upon.\" (Sheikh Abdullah has alleged that most of the Muslim soldiers of the Militia were either discharged or imprisoned before his arrest in 1953. The Militia (dubbed as Dagan Brigade) was converted from a State Militia to a regular unit of the Indian Army on 2 December 1972 and redesignated the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry)Sheikh Abdullah spoke at the UN Security Council on 5 February 1948 thus: \"The (tribal) raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people \u2014 mostly Hindus and Sikhs, but Muslims, too \u2014 abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar.\"\n\n\n== Return to activism ==\n\n\n=== Arrest and release ===\nOn 8 August 1953 he was dismissed as Prime Minister by the then Sadr-i-Riyasat (Constitutional Head of State) Dr. Karan Singh, son of the erstwhile Maharajah Hari Singh, on the charge that he had lost the confidence of his cabinet (not the house). He was denied the opportunity to prove his majority on the floor of the house and his dissident cabinet minister Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed was appointed as Prime Minister. Sheikh Abdullah was immediately arrested and later jailed for eleven years, accused of conspiracy against the State in the infamous \"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\".According to Sheikh Abdullah his dismissal and arrest were engineered by the central government headed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He has quoted B.N. Mullicks' statements in his book \"My Years with Nehru\" in support of his statement. A.G. Noorani writing in Frontline supports this view, as according to him Nehru himself ordered the arrest. On 8 April 1964 the State Government dropped all charges in the so-called \"Kashmir Conspiracy Case\". Sheikh Abdullah was released and returned to Srinagar where he was accorded an unprecedented welcome by the people of the valley\".After his release he was reconciled with Nehru. Nehru requested Sheikh Abdullah to act as a bridge between India and Pakistan and make President Ayub to agree to come to New Delhi for talks for a final solution of the Kashmir problem. President Ayub Khan also sent telegrams to Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah with the message that as Pakistan too was a party to the Kashmir dispute any resolution of the conflict without its participation would not be acceptable to Pakistan. This paved the way for Sheikh Abdullah's visit to Pakistan to help broker a solution to the Kashmir problem.Sheikh Abdullah went to Pakistan in spring of 1964. President Ayub Khan of Pakistan held extensive talks with him to explore various avenues for solving the Kashmir problem and agreed to come to Delhi in mid June for talks with Nehru as suggested by him. Even the date of his proposed visit was fixed and communicated to New Delhi. However, before Ayub Khan could make his visit, Nehru died on 27 May 1964. The Sheikh was en route to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir when he received the news. He addressed a public rally at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and returned to Delhi. On his suggestion, President Ayub Khan sent a high level Pakistani delegation led by his Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto along with him to take part in the last rites of Jawaharlal Nehru.After Nehru's death in 1964, Sheikh Abdullah was again interned from 1965 to 1968. The internment was ordered by Lal Bahadur Shastri and continued by Indira Gandhi. The Plebiscite Front was also banned. This was allegedly done to prevent him and the Plebiscite Front which was supported by him from taking part in elections in Kashmir. Again, he was exiled from Kashmir in 1971-72 for 18 months, during which period the Indo-Pak war of 1971 came to be waged.\n\n\n=== After Indo-Pakistan war and creation of Bangladesh ===\n\nIn 1971, Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in erstwhile East Pakistan between Pakistan and Bangladesh joined later by India, and subsequently war broke out on the western border of India between India and Pakistan, both of which culminated in the creation of Bangladesh. Sheikh Abdullah watching the alarming turn of events in the subcontinent realised that for the survival of this region there was an urgent need to stop pursuing confrontational politics and promoting solution of issues by a process of reconciliation and dialogue rather than confrontation. Critics of Sheikh hold the view that he gave up the cherished goal of plebiscite for gaining Chief Minister's chair.\nHe started talks with the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for normalising the situation in the region and came to an accord called 1974 Indira-Sheikh accord with Indira Gandhi, then India's Prime Minister, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in lieu of the people being given the right to self-rule by a democratically elected Government (as envisaged under article 370 of the Constitution of India) rather than the puppet government which till then ruled the State.\n\n\n== Return to power ==\nHe assumed the position of Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. The Central Government and the ruling Congress Party withdrew its support so that the State Assembly had to be dissolved and mid term elections called.The National Conference won an overwhelming majority in the subsequent elections and re-elected Sheikh Abdullah as Chief Minister. He remained as Chief Minister till his death in 1982.\nAbdullah, described as a six feet four inches (1.93 m) to six feet six inches (1.98 m) tall man, was fluent in both Kashmiri and Urdu. His biography in Urdu entitled Atish-e-Chinar was written by the noted Kashmiri author M.Y. Taing and published after Sheikh Abdullah's death. It is often referred to as his autobiography as Taing claimed that he only acted as an amanuensis. It is based on extensive interviews that Taing had with Sheikh Abdullah and provides valuable information on Sheikh Abdullah's family background, early life, ringside glimpses of happenings in Kashmir at a crucial juncture in its history, and his viewpoint about the political events in Kashmir in which he himself played a central role.After his death his eldest son Dr. Farooq Abdullah was elected as the Chief Minister of the State.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1933 he married Akbar Jahan, the daughter of Michael Harry Nedou, of Slovak and British descent, and his Kashmiri wife Mirjan. Michael Harry Nedou was himself the proprietor of a hotel at the tourist resort of Gulmarg (The writer Tariq Ali claims that Akbar Jehan was previously married in 1928 to an Arab Karam Shah who disappeared after a Calcutta newspaper Liberty reported that he was actually T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) a British Intelligence officer. He claims that Akbar Jehan was divorced by her first husband in 1929.)\n\n\n== Commentaries ==\n\n\n=== Pakistani view ===\nThe government of Pakistan in 1947 viewed Abdullah and his party as agents of Nehru and did not recognise his leadership of Kashmir. He spoke against Pakistani government in United Nations by comparing it with Hitler's rule, and he also endorsed Indian stand on Jammu and Kashmir. However, there was a change in Pakistan's viewpoint with the passage of time. When he visited Pakistan in 1964 he was awarded a tumultuous welcome by the people of Pakistan. Among the persons who received him was Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas his once colleague and later political enemy who earlier in his book Kashmakash had denounced Sheikh Abdullah as a turncoat and traitor. Chaudhary Ghulam Abbas embraced him and in his speech described him as one of the greatest leaders of the subcontinent and a great benefactor of the Muslims of the subcontinent. President Ayub Khan and his then Foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto discussed the Kashmir problem with him. The government of Pakistan treated him as a state guest. Sheikh Abdullah had the rare distinction of having poems in his praise written by three major Pakistani Urdu poets namely Hafeez Jullundhri, Josh and Faiz Ahmed Faiz who admired his lifelong struggle against injustice and for democratic rights of the common man.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Flame of the Chinar, a 1998 Indian feature documentary film directed by Zul Vellani covers his life and works. It was produced by the Government of India's Film Division. Anang Desai portrayed Abdullah in the 2013 Indian docudrama television series Pradhanmantri, which covered the tenures of Indian PMs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Kashmiris\nHistory of Jammu and Kashmir\nKashmir conflict\nInstrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)\nKashmiriyat \u2013 a socio-cultural ethos of religious harmony and Kashmiri consciousness.\nPolitical Parties in Kashmir in 1947\nList of topics on the land and the people of \"Jammu and Kashmir\"\nKashmir Conspiracy Case\nList of political families\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSourcesAnkit,  Rakesh. \"Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah of Kashmir, 1965\u20131975: From Externment to Enthronement.\" Studies in Indian Politics 6.1 (2018): 88-102  online\nGuha, Ramachandra. \"Opening a window in Kashmir.\" Economic and Political Weekly (2004): 3905-3913. online\nAbdullah, Sheikh; Taing, M.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Rahman. The name means \"servant of the most gracious\", ar-Rahman being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.The letter A of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. Because the letter R is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Rahman, the usual pronunciation corresponds to Abd ar-Rahman. Alternative transliterations include Abd ar-Rahman, Abdulrahman, Abdur Rehman, Abdul Rehman, Abidur Rahman, Abdrrahman, and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.

Two Hollywood writers, Matt Graham and Zak Shaikh were also brought in during development to work on the screenplay.  The film is produced by Masha Sajdeh, Steven Cantor and Jamie Schutz. Doosra is the story of how cricket changed India, seen through the eyes of a young girl. The film is a groundbreaking feature format a fictional narrative weaving with archival footage well-documented incidents from India's political, economic and sporting history at the turn of the millennium.Doosra is slang for \u2018the other one.\u2019  In cricketing terminology, a ball that unexpectedly goes the other way. In the film, Doosra represents a country that overcome centuries old inferiority complex to find its confidence through cricket. And also, a girl who refuses to be defined by what centuries of social tradition expect a girl to be.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nPlabita Borthakur as Tara\nAnkur Vikal\nSamidha Guru\nTvisha Seema\nKrishna Gokani\nRajeev Ankit\nMohammad iliyas\nKusum Gupta\nRenu Seth\nAkshay Ajit Singh\nNavin Ratawa\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSet between the last decade of the previous millennium and the turn of this one, the film weaves together two stories of courage and identity. One, played out under the harsh glare of the national spotlight by a maverick captain, Sourav Ganguly, and his defiant team. The other, deeply private, in an orthodox household in small town India, where an equally defiant young girl, Tara, takes on social prejudices as she comes to terms with her own mind and body.Both stories have their principal characters fighting the demons of tradition, classism and orthodoxy. What brings the two narratives to a head is a single event: When Captain Sourav Ganguly pulls off his shirt and waves it bare-chested from the hallowed altar of cricket - the balcony at Lords in London - to celebrate India\u2019s 2002 NatWest final victory against their erstwhile colonial rulers. A defiant celebratory act is suddenly elevated to an iconic image for a nation that finally sheds its centuries of inferiority complex to stand proud and comfortable in its own bare skin.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe music of the film is composed by Ram Sampath.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDoosra at IMDb"

        "article": "Dama Dam Mast Qalandar is a spiritual Sufi song written in the honour of the most revered Sufi saint of Sindh, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar (1177\u20131274) of Sehwan Sharif. The original poem was initially written by the 13th-century Sufi poet Amir Khusrow, then further modified by Bulleh Shah in the 18th century.\nIt is said that this qawwali was adapted from the original prayer by Amir Khusrow, and was then modified completely by Bulleh Shah. Bulleh Shah gave an entirely different color to the qawwali, adding verses in praises of Shahbaz Qalandar and giving it a large tint of Sindhi culture. The poem includes a reference to the town of Sehwan, which is home to the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. The word \"Laal\" can refer to Jhulelal as a young man, or his red dress.\nWith origins dating back 600 years, \"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar\" is a popular traditional Sindhi Sufi Islamic folk song across the northern Indian subcontinent, especially Punjab & Sindh, as well as Iran. Various renditions of the song have been composed and performed by numerous composers and singers.\n\n\n== Ashiq Hussain song ==\nPopular modern renditions of the song include the melody composed by Pakistani music composer Master Ashiq Hussain. Originally called \"Lal Meri Pat\", the song was initially composed for the 1956 Pakistani film Jabroo. It was sung by Inayat Hussain Bhatti, Fazal Hussain, and A.R. Bismil. Ashiq Hussain was reduced to poverty in later life, living in a slum at the Bazar-e-Hakiman in Lahore. When Hussain died in 2017, most Pakistanis were unaware that he was the original composer of the modern melody.\n\n\n== Noor Jehan song ==\nThe most popular modern rendition of the song, which includes Ashiq Hussain's melody, was \"Dama Dam Mast Qalandar\" from the 1969 Pakistani film Dillan Dey Soudey, where it was modified by Nazir Ali and sung by Noor Jehan. It was then sung by other Pakistani singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Aziz Mian, Abida Parveen, the Sabri Brothers, Reshma, Komal Rizvi, and Junoon. The song has also been performed by the Bangladeshi singer Runa Laila, and Indian artists like Hans Raj Hans, the Wadali brothers, Harshdeep Kaur, Nooran Sisters, and Mika Singh (with Yo Yo Honey Singh).\n\n\n== Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan song ==\nPakistani musicians Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and M. Arshad composed a new song inspired by \"Dam Mast Qalandar\", with a different melody and arrangement. It was sung by Khan and released as \"Dam Mast Mast\" in his 1991 album Mast Qalander (Vol 14). Khan also performed the song for the 1992 Pakistani film Boxer. in both Punjabi and Urdu. His song is variously called \"Dam Mast Qalandar Mast Mast\", \"Dam Mast Qalandar\" or \"Mast Mast\". In 2016, British-Iranian singer Sami Yusuf performed a rendition of Khan's song in his album Barakah.\nThe Bollywood music director Viju Shah used Khan's version to produce the hit song \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\" for the Bollywood film Mohra (1994), the soundtrack album of which sold more than 8 million units. In turn, \"Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast\" was remade as \"Cheez Badi\" for the 2017 film Machine.\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Shiraz ( (listen); Persian: \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632\u200e, romanized: \u0160\u00eer\u00e2z [\u0283i\u02d0\u02c8r\u0252\u02d0z] (listen)) is the fourth-most-populous city of Iran and the capital of Fars Province, which is also known as Pars (\u067e\u0627\u0631\u0633, P\u0101rs) and Persis (Persia). At the 2016 census, the population of the city was 1,869,001 and its built-up area with \"Shahr-e Jadid-e Sadra\" (Sadra New Town) was home to 1,565,572 inhabitants. Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the \"Rudkhaneye Khoshk\" (The Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. Shiraz is one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia.\nThe earliest reference to the city, as Tirazi\u0161, is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC. The modern city was founded or restored by the Umayyads in 693 and grew prominent under the successive Iranian Saffarid and Buyid dynasties in the 9th and 10th\u201311th centuries, respectively. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, due to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. It was the capital of Persia during the Zand dynasty from 1750 until 1800. Two famous poets of Iran, Hafez and Saadi, are from Shiraz, whose tombs are on the north side of the current city boundaries.\nShiraz is known as the city of poets, literature, and flowers. It is also considered by many Iranians to be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens, and fruit trees that can be seen in the city, such as Eram Garden. Shiraz has had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of kilim, called gilim and jajim in the villages and among the tribes. In Shiraz industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork, and rugs dominate. Shir\u0101z also has a major oil refinery and is a major center for Iran's electronic industries: 53% of Iran's electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz. Shiraz is home to Iran's first solar power plant. Recently the city's first wind turbine has been installed above Babakuhi mountain near the city.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe earliest reference to the city is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BCE, found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient Elamite name a city called Tirazi\u0161. Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tira\u010dis/ or /\u0107ira\u010dis/. This name became Old Persian /\u0161ir\u0101ji\u0161/; through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name Shir\u0101z. The name Shiraz also appears on clay sealings found at a 2nd-century CE Sassanid ruin, east of the city. By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz has derived from a son of Tahmuras, the third Sh\u0101h (King) of the world according to Ferdowsi's Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Islamic era ===\nThough, there is no definitive record of its existence prior to the late 7th century CE, few archaeological finds dating from 1933 and beyond indicate that the site or vicinity of Shiraz was likely settled in the pre-Islamic era as early as the 6th century BCE. A number of Sasanian-era remains have been discovered around the city, including reliefs at Barm-e Delak to the east and Guyim to the northwest, and ruins of Sasanian fortresses at Qasr-e Abu Nasr to the east and Fahandezh. The latter is identified with the fortress of Shahmobad mentioned as being in Shiraz by the 10th-century geographical work, Hudud al-'alam. The names \"Tirrazish\" and \"Shirrazish\" were found on Elamite tablets in Persepolis, while Sasanian and early Islamic-era clay seals found at Qasr-e-Abu Nasr mention the name \"Shiraz\" alongside the name of the Sasanian administrative district of the area, Ardashir-Khwarrah. According to the diplomat and academic John Limbert, this indicates that the name \"Shiraz\" is traced back to the Elamite \"Shirrazish\" and that both refer to a settlement that existed at the site of Qasr-e-Abu Nasr. This settlement prospered between the 6th and 8th-centuries CE and was possibly the administrative center for the Shiraz plain until the modern city of Shiraz was founded. Nonetheless, the lack of references to Shiraz in early Persian sources suggests the city could not have been more than a way-station in the plain in which it lays.\n\n\n=== Early Islamic era ===\nThe present city of Shiraz was founded or restored in 693 by Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, the brother of the Umayyad viceroy of the eastern half of the caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, or the latter's kinsman Muhammad ibn Qasim. The Arab Muslim army had conquered the wider region of Fars, where the site of Shiraz is located, in several expeditions launched from their garrison town of Basra between 640 and 653, and specifically captured the immediate area around Shiraz early on, in 641. This area did not possess any cities, though there were a number of forts which were forced to pay tribute to the Arabs. The Sasanians held firm in Istakhr, their capital in Fars, until the Arabs captured it in a heavy battle in 653, during which the plain of Shiraz had been utilized as an Arab campground. Because of Istakhr's deep association with the Sasanian Empire and the Zoroastrian religion, the Arabs sought to establish in nearby Shiraz a rival cultural and administrative center. Thus, during its initial founding in 693, the city was planned to be much larger than Isfahan. However, the initial ambitions were not realized and Shiraz remained a \"provincial backwater\" in the shadow of Istakhr until at least the late 9th century, according to Limbert. This is partly attributed to the reticence of the largely Zoroastrian population of Fars to inhabit the Islamic Arab city. As the population gradually shifted to Islam from Zoroastrianism and Istakhr concurrently declined, Shiraz grew into the practical center of Fars.According to Muslim traditional sources, Shiraz was used as a hideout by three of the brothers of the Shia Muslim imam Ali al-Ridha following the latter's death in 817/18 and later by one of the brothers' sons, Ali ibn Hamza ibn Musa, until he was found and executed by the Abbasid authorities in circa 835. As Abbasid authority waned during this period, regional dynasties emerged with considerable autonomy. In the late 9th century, the Iranian Muslim Saffarid dynasty under Ya'qub ibn al-Layth made Shiraz the capital of their autonomous state, which encompassed most of modern-day Iran. In 894, Ya'qub's brother and successor, Amr, founded the city's first congregational mosque, today known as the Atigh Jame' Mosque.The Iranian Buyid dynasty under Imad al-Dawla Ali ibn Buya ousted the Saffarids in 933 and his nephew and successor, 'Adud al-Dawla Fana Khusraw, took over and ruled Fars between 949 and 983, and added Iraq, the seat of the Abbasid Caliphate, to his Shiraz-based domains in 977; the Abbasids thenceforth became a puppet state of the Shiraz-based dynasty. Shiraz developed into the largest and most prosperous city of Fars and an important economic and cultural center of the caliphate. Adud al-Dawla had a large library, a hospital and several mosques, bazaars, caravanserais, palaces and gardens built in the city, while south of it he erected a fortified camp for his troops, known as Kard Fana Khusraw, in 974. One of the congregational mosques built by Adud al-Dawla has survived until the present day. Two Zoroastrian fire temples also existed in Shiraz, catering to the Persians who had not converted to Islam. One of Adud al-Dawla's palaces stretched out for nearly three miles and consisted of 360 rooms.Under the Buyids, Shiraz was divided into twelve quarters and had eight gates. It owed its economic prosperity to the booming agricultural trade of Fars. The city largely consumed the agricultural products of the province, including grapes, linen, wool, cotton, collyrium, rose, violet and palm-blossom water. It was also a market for rug weavers and painters to sell their pricey products, a testament to the residents' wealth. At the time, wine, grains, gold and silver were exported from the Farsi port cities of Siraf and Najairam. Adud al-Dawla patronized scientific, medical and Islamic religious research in Shiraz.The city was spared destruction by the invading Mongols, when its local ruler offered tributes and submission to Genghis Khan. Shiraz was again spared by Tamerlane, when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shoja agreed to submit to the invader. In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, thanks to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. For this reason the city was named by classical geographers Dar al-'Elm, the House of Knowledge. Among the Iranian poets, mystics and philosophers born in Shiraz were the poets Sa'di and Hafiz, the mystic Ruzbehan, and the philosopher Mulla Sadra. Thus Shiraz has been nicknamed \"The Athens of Iran\".\nAs early as the 11th century, several hundred thousand people inhabited Shiraz. In the 14th century Shiraz had sixty thousand inhabitants. During the 16th century it had a population of 200,000 people, which by the mid-18th century had decreased to only 55,000.\n\n\n=== Safavid era ===\n\nIn 1504, Shiraz was captured by the forces of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Throughout the Safavid empire (1501\u20131722) Shiraz remained a provincial capital and Emam Qoli Khan, the governor of Fars under Shah Abbas I, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style as those built during the same period in Isfahan, the capital of the Empire. After the fall of the Safavids, Shiraz suffered a period of decline, worsened by the raids of the Afghans and the rebellion of its governor against Nader Shah; the latter sent troops to suppress the revolt. The city was besieged for many months and eventually sacked. At the time of Nader Shah's murder in 1747, most of the historical buildings of the city were damaged or ruined, and its population fell to 50,000, one-quarter of that during the 16th century.Shiraz soon returned to prosperity under the rule of Karim Khan Zand, who made it his capital in 1762. Employing more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque, and one of the finest covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed an irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls. However, Karim Khan's heirs failed to secure his gains. When Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty, eventually came to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shiraz by destroying the city's fortifications and moving the national capital to Tehran. Although lowered to the rank of a provincial capital, Shiraz maintained a level of prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to the Persian Gulf. Its governorship was a royal prerogative throughout the Qajar dynasty. Many of the famous gardens, buildings and residences built during this time contribute to the city's present skyline.\nShiraz is the birthplace of the co-founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, the B\u00e1b (Siyyid 'Ali-Muhammad, 1819\u20131850). In this city, on the evening of 22 May 1844, he first declared his mission as the bearer of a new divine revelation. For this reason Shiraz is a holy city for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and the city, particularly the house of the B\u00e1b, was identified as a place of pilgrimage. Due to the hostile climate towards Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Iran, the house has been the target of repeated attacks; the house was destroyed in 1979, to be paved over two years later and made into a public square.In 1910, a pogrom of the Jewish quarter started after false rumours that the Jews had ritually murdered a Muslim girl. In the course of the riots, 12 Jews were murdered and about 50 were injured, and the 6,000 Jews of Shiraz were robbed of all their possessions.During the Pahlavi dynasty, Shiraz became the center of attention again. Many important landmarks like Tombs of Poets' such as Sa'di and Hafiz, were constructed and presented to the public.\nLacking any great industrial, religious or strategic importance, Shiraz became an administrative center, although its population has nevertheless grown considerably since the 1979 revolution.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nThe city's municipality and other related institutions have initiated restoration and reconstruction projects.Some of the most recent projects have been the complete restoration of the Arg of Karim Khan and of the Vakil Bath, as well as a comprehensive plan for the preservation of the old city quarters. Other noteworthy initiatives include the total renovation of the Qur'an Gate and the mausoleum of the poet Khwaju Kermani, both located in the Allah-u-Akbar Gorge, as well as the restoration and expansion of the mausoleum of the famous Shiraz-born poets Hafiz and Saadi.Several different construction projects are currently underway that will modernize the city's infrastructure.After the Iranian Revolution, Shiraz was re-established as the capital of Iranian Art and Culture among the people. Shiraz is known as the capital of Persian Art, Culture and Literature. However, the current government has tried to re-brand the city as \"Sevomin haram-e ahle beit\" meaning \"Third home of Saints\" referring to the Shahcheragh shrine and some other holy places in the city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nShiraz is located in the south of Iran and the northwest of Kerman Province. It is built in a green plain at the foot of the Zagros Mountains 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level. Shiraz is 800 kilometres (500 mi) south of Tehran.A seasonal river, Dry River, flows through the northern part of the city and on into Maharloo Lake. As of 1920, the area had a large forest of oak trees.\n\n\n=== Gardens ===\nShiraz contains a considerable number of gardens. Due to population growth in the city, many of these gardens may be lost to give way to new developments. Although some measures have been taken by the Municipality to preserve these gardens, many illegal developments still endanger them.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nShiraz's climate has distinct seasons, and is overall classed as a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BSk), though it is only a little short of a hot semi-arid climate (BSh) or a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa). Summers are hot, with a July average high of 38.8 \u00b0C (101.8 \u00b0F). Winters are cool, with average low temperatures below freezing in December and January. Around 300 mm (12 in) of rain falls each year, almost entirely in the winter months, though in some cases as much as this has fallen in a single month (as in January 1965 and December 2004), whilst in the year from July 1965 to June 1966 as little as 82.9 millimetres (3.3 in) fell. The wettest year has been 1955/1956 with as much as 857.2 millimetres (33.75 in), though since 1959 the highest has been around 590 millimetres (23.2 in) in each of 1995/1996 and 2004/2005. Due to Shiraz' high elevation and low latitude, the UV index is extremely high during summer which is further exacerbated by the high frequency of sunshine.\nDespite being in a relatively dry climate, extreme weather is not a rare occasion. Most recently, in March, 25th, 2019, flash floods from heavy rains has resulted in 19 deaths and 200+ injuries.\nThe highest record temperature was 43.2 \u00b0C (109.8 \u00b0F) on 12 July 1998 and the lowest record temperature was \u221214 \u00b0C (7 \u00b0F) on 5 January 1973.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\n  \nShiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice. Industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork and rugs dominate. Shir\u0101z also has a major oil refinery and is also a major center for Iran's electronic industries. 53% of Iran's electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz.\nAgriculture has always been a major part of the economy in and around Shiraz.

        "article": "Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (Urdu: \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0633\u0639\u06cc\u062f\u200e, born 5 June 1950) is a Pakistani leader, who is a co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the chief of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah (JuD), operating mainly from Pakistan.Saeed is listed on the NIA Most Wanted list, and a UN designated terrorist. India has banned his organisations LeT and JuD as terrorist organisations. The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Russia and Australia have also banned Lashkar-e-Taiba. India has demanded that Saeed be handed over to them by Pakistan but there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. Saeed has denied ever being a leader of LeT and said allegations that he planned attacks in India were baseless.Hafiz Saeed is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHafiz Muhammad Saeed was born in Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan. As told by him, his father, Maulana Kamal-ud-Din, a religious scholar, landlord and farmer, along with his family started migrating from East Punjab and reached Pakistan in around four months in the autumn of 1947. His family lost 36 of its members when migrating from Hisar, Haryana (erstwhile Punjab) to Lahore during the partition of India. The family is of Gujjar background and three of his brothers, Hafiz Hamid, Hafiz Mastodon and Hafiz Hannan, are involved in Islamic activism as well, having previously ran Islamic centres in Boston in the United States.He was named hafiz because he memorized the Qur'an during his childhood, a time during which he was already enthusiastic about the verses on jihad. He then attended the Government College Sargodha (now University of Sargodha) before getting a Master's in Islamic Studies at the King Saud University in Riyadh.A major early influence on his life and ideology was his maternal uncle, and later father-in-law, Hafiz Abdullah Bahawalpuri, who was a famed theologian belonging to the Ahl-i Hadith, who held that democracy was incompatible with Islam (which alienated him with Maulana Maududi's Jamaat-e-Islami) and argued, on the importance of jihad, \"that only in jihad does one offer one\u2019s life in the way of Allah, which elevates it to a higher plane than merely fulfilling other religious responsibilities such as saying prayers and paying zakat, also entailing sacrifices and adjustments, but not at the scale evident in jihad\" and \"considered shahadat (martyrdom) to be the crux of jihad.\" Bahawalpuri's only son, Abdul Rehman Makki, is Saeed's brother-in-law and has been described as \"his close partner.\"General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq appointed Hafiz Muhammad Saeed to the Council on Islamic Ideology, and he later served as an Islamic Studies teacher at the University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan. He was sent to Saudi Arabia in the early 1980s by the university for higher studies where he met Saudi sheikhs who were taking part in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. They inspired him in taking an active role supporting the mujahideen in Afghanistan. During his studies at the King Saud University, where he was gold medalist for his academic performances as well as taught there, he came under the influence of Salafi scholars like Shaykh Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen and especially Shaykh Ibn Baz.Hafiz Muhammad Saeed held two master's degrees from the University of Punjab and a specialisation in Islamic Studies and Arabic Language from King Saud University.In 1987, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, along with Abdullah Azzam, founded Markaz Dawa-Wal-Irshad, a group with roots in the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadis.This organisation spawned the jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba in 1987, with the help of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence officers.Lashkar's primary target is the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. He is also quoted as saying, \"There cannot be any peace while India remains intact. Cut them, cut them so much that they kneel before you and ask for mercy.\"\n\n\n== Family ==\nSaeed's son Talha Saeed serves as the Lashkar-e-Taiba second-in-command. He controls the finances of Lashkar. In 2019, Talha escaped an assassination attempt when a bomb inside a refrigerator shop exploded in Lahore. According to Lashkar the bombing was attributed to the infighting in the Lashkar and R&AW.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== 1994 ===\nIn 1994, Saeed visited the United States and \"spoke at Islamic centres in Houston, Chicago and Boston\".\n\n\n=== 2001\u20132002 ===\nPakistan took Saeed into custody on 21 December 2001 due to an Indian government assertion that he was involved in 13 December 2001 attack on the Lok Sabha. He was held until 31 March 2002, released, then taken back into custody on 15 May. He was placed under house arrest on 31 October 2002 after his wife Maimoona Saeed sued the province of Punjab and the Pakistan federal government for what she claimed was an illegal detention.\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nAfter 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the provincial government of Punjab, Pakistan arrested him on 9 August 2006 and kept him under house arrest but he was released on 28 August 2006 after a Lahore High Court order. He was arrested again on the same day by the provincial government and was kept in the Canal Rest House in Sheikhupura. He was finally released after the Lahore High Court order on 17 October 2006.\n\n\n=== 2008\u20132009 ===\nAfter the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, India submitted a formal request to the U.N. Security Council to put the group Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Hafiz Muhammad Saeed on the list of individuals and organisations sanctioned by the United Nations for association with terrorism. India has accused the organisation and its leader, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, of being virtually interchangeable with Lashkar-e-Taiba. India said that the close links between the organisations, as well as the 2,500 offices and 11 seminaries that Jamaat-ud-Dawa maintains in Pakistan, \"are of immediate concern with regard to their efforts to mobilise and orchestrate terrorist activities.\" On 10 December 2008, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed denied a link between LeT and JuD in an interview with Pakistan's Geo television stating that \"no Lashkar-e-Taiba man is in Jamaat-ud-Dawa and I have never been a chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba.\"On 11 December 2008, Hafiz Muhammed Saeed was again placed under house arrest when the United Nations declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa to be an LeT front. Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was held in house arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order law, which allows authorities to detain temporarily individuals deemed likely to create disorder, until early June 2009 when the Lahore High Court, deeming the containment to be unconstitutional, ordered Hafiz Muhammad Saeed to be released. India quickly expressed its disappointment with the decision.On 6 July 2009, the Pakistani government filed an appeal of the court's decision. Deputy Attorney General Shah Khawar told the Associated Press that \"Hafiz Saeed at liberty is a security threat.\"On 25 August 2009, Interpol issued a red notice against Hafiz Saeed, along with Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, in response to Indian requests for his extradition.Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was again placed under house arrest by the Pakistani authorities in September 2009.On 12 October 2009, the Lahore High Court quashed all cases against Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and set him free. The court also notified that Jama'at-ud-Da'wah is not a banned organisation and can work freely in Pakistan. Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, one of two judges hearing the case, observed \"In the name of terrorism we cannot brutalise the law.\"\n\n\n=== Indian attempts at extradition ===\nOn 11 May 2011, in an effort to place pressure on Pakistan, India publicly revealed a list of its 50 most wanted fugitives hiding in Pakistan. India believes Hafiz Saeed is a fugitive, but the Indian arrest warrant had no influence in Pakistan and presently has no effect on Saeed's movements within Pakistan. Following the Lahore High Court ruling, Saeed has been moving freely around the country. For many years, India has demanded that Saeed be handed over but there is no extradition treaty between the two countries.\n\n\n=== Declaration as a terrorist by the United States ===\nThe United States declared two Lashkar-e-Tayyiba leaders\u2014Nazir Ahmad Chaudhry and Muhammad Hussein Gill\u2014specially designated global terrorists. The State Department also maintained LeT's designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and added the following aliases to its listing of LeT: Jama\u2019at-ud-Dawa, Al-Anfal Trust, Tehrik-i-Hurmat-i-Rasool, and Tehrik-i-Tahafuz Qibla Awwal. The Department of Treasury said that LeT was responsible for the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai which killed nearly 200 people. The group's leader is Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who is listed under UN Security Council Resolution 1267.\n\n\n=== Cooperation with Islamabad ===\nIn keeping with Pakistani establishment's wishes, Lashkar has been keeping focus on India and Saeed is among those who are thought to have helped Pakistan in capturing important al-Qaeda members like Abu Zubaydah. Senior Pakistani officials have said that Saeed is helping in de-radicalisation and rehabilitation of former extremists and that security is being provided to him because he could be targeted by militants who disapprove of Saeed's co-operation with Islamabad.\n\n\n=== US bounty ===\nIn April 2012, the United States announced a bounty of US$10 million on Hafeez Saeed, for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Saeed stated that he had nothing to do with the Mumbai attacks and condemned them. When asked about the bounty, Saeed replied, \"I am living my life in the open and the US can contact me whenever they want.\" He subsequently stated that he was ready to face \"any American court\" to answer the charges and added that if Washington wanted to contact him, they knew where he was. \"This is a laughable, absurd announcement. Here I am in front of everyone, not hiding in a cave,\" he said in a press conference. Saeed identified his leading role in the Difa-e-Pakistan Council and US attempts to placate India as reasons behind the bounty.\n\n\n== Arrest and trial ==\nOn 3 July 2019, 23 cases related to terror financing and money laundering under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997 were registered by Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan. According to CTD, JuD was financing terrorism from the funds collected by several non-profit organisations and trusts that included Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust, Muaz Bin Jabal Trust, etc. CTD had banned these non-profit organisations in April 2019. On further investigations,  CTD had found that these organisations were linked with JuD and were in touch with the top leadership of JuD.On 17 July 2019, Saeed was arrested in Gujranwala by the Punjab CTD on the charges of terror financing. He was subsequently sent to the prison on judicial remand by a Gujranwala Anti Terrorism Court (ATC). On 27 September 2019, during the United Nations General Assembly, USA asked Pakistan to prosecute Saeed, Masood Azhar and other UN-designated terrorists. On 30 November 2019, the Government of Pakistan stated that they will prosecute Saeed. On 11 December 2019, he was indicted by the ATC in the charges of terror financing in several cities of Punjab province of Pakistan. As of December 2019, Saeed resides in the Kot Lakhpat jail also known as Central Jail Lahore. He was convicted for five years by a Pakistan court for financing terrorism, in February 2020. On November 19, 2020 a Pakistani court sentenced him for 5 years in prison on terrorism-financing charges making the conviction for a total of 10 years meanwhile an anti-terrorism court in the city of Lahore on fined Hafiz Muhammad Saeed 110,000 rupees (about $700). On 24 December he was sentenced to 15 and a half years in jail by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan in one more terror financing case along with Rs20,000 (about $125) fine.While being in prison, Saeed's former residence in Lahore was targeted by a bomb blast on June 23, 2021, resulting in the death of three people and the wounding of 22 more. Three people were arrested for the attack. Pakistan\u2019s national security adviser Moeed Yusuf said that while the three arrested were Pakistani citizens who planted the bomb, it was suspected that \"India was behind the attack\".\n\n\n== Views ==\n\n\n=== Pakistani government ===\nHafiz Saeed has criticised Pakistani leaders and has stated that they should aspire to be more like British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson. He had declared his admiration for the British Conservative Party along with several Tory MPs when he lodged a petition to the Lahore High Court calling for public officials in Pakistan to tone down their privileged lifestyles. According to The Daily Telegraph, Saeed wrote in the petition that while Pakistan's political elite were 'living like kings and princes in palatial government houses,' Britain's prime minister lived in a 'four-bedroom flat.' He added, 'When the sun never set on the British Empire, the chief executive of that great country lived in the same house of a few marlas in a small street. That is truly Islamic, that is like following the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet.'Speaking on the issue of arrest of separatist Kashmiri leader Masarat Alam by the Jammu and Kashmir government, Saeed said, \"Jihad is the duty of an Islamic government ... there is a government in Pakistan and it has always taken the stand that it is the right of Kashmiris to attain freedom. I say what our Army will do to secure the right of the Kashmiris is jihad ... We extend help to Kashmiris alongside government ... we call this jihad.\"Criticising his anti-India comments, Indian Muslim leader Asaduddin Owaisi said, \"People like Hafiz Saeed are unaware about teachings of Islam, jihad in Islam. They are killing innocent lives in Pakistan, children are being killed. They are using Pakistan for maligning another country. The Government of India should take strict action against it and I condemn his comments in clear and strong words.\"\n\n\n=== Indian government ===\nIn January 2013, India's then Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde released a statement on the alleged existence of Hindu terrorism as well as the existence of Hindu terror camps on Indian soil, being run and organised by the BJP and the RSS. As a result, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa welcomed Shinde's statements and congratulated him for admitting the existence of Hindu terrorism. Hafiz Saeed demanded that the United States take serious notice of this statement by the Indian home minister regarding Hindu terrorist camps in India. \"The US should now carry out drone attacks on these terror camps in India,\" Saeed said.\nIn September 2014, Saeed accused India of \"water terrorism\". Though there was flood crisis in India too, Saeed blamed India for flood crisis in Pakistan. In several tweets on social media he said, \"Indian gov discharged water in rivers without notification & has given false information; an act of open mischief,\" \"India has used water to attack Pakistan, We are in state of War. India's water aggression must be taken to the UN security council.\"Responding to a question about the nuclear warning issued by Indian authorities in Jammu and Kashmir after the 2013 India\u2013Pakistan border incidents, Saeed said that in case of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, India should distribute nuclear safety pamphlets in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta rather than in Kashmir.\n\n\n=== Punjabi as national language ===\n\nHafiz Saeed has questioned Pakistan's decision to adopt Urdu (only 8% of Pakistanis speak Urdu as a first language) as its national language in a country where the majority of people speak the Punjabi language. He advocated that Punjabi should be made the national language.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAll Parties Hurriyat Conference\nSyed Ali Shah Geelani\nKashmir conflict\n2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election\nDifa-e-Pakistan Council\nPhantom (2015 film)\nList of fugitives from justice who disappeared\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hafiz Saeed at Wikimedia Commons\nHafiz Saeed at IMDb \n\"Exclusive: Pakistani with U.S. bounty said helping de-radicalize militants\" \u2013 Reuters, 6 April 2012\nChronology of indictment of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed by Outlook"

She was one of two Nikahi wives.\nHis kingdom, long protected by the East India Company (EIC) under treaty, was annexed by the EIC on 11 February 1856, two days before the ninth anniversary of his coronation. The Nawab was exiled to Garden Reach in Metiabruz, then a suburb of Kolkata, where he lived out the rest of his life on a generous pension. He was a poet, playwright, dancer and great patron of the arts. He is widely credited with the revival of Kathak as a major form of classical Indian dance.\n\n\n== As a King ==\n\nWajid Ali Shah succeeded to the throne of Awadh when the kingdom was well past its heyday. The British had annexed much of the kingdom under the treaty of 1801, and had impoverished Awadh by imposing a hugely expensive, British-run army and repeated demands for loans. The independence of Awadh in name was tolerated by the British only because they still needed a buffer state between their presence in the east and south, and the remnants of the Mughal Empire to the north.\nWajid Ali Shah succeeded to the throne of Awadh when the kingdom was in decline. The British East India Company (EIC) had annexed much of the kingdom under it's rule in a treaty signed with the kingdom in 1801, and stymied the Awadh economy by imposing the costs of maintaining the Bengal Army on the kingdom's coffer, in addition to repeatedly demanding loans. However, the EIC refrained from annexing the remainder of the kingdom because they needed a buffer state between their territories to the east and south, and the Mughal Empire to the north.Wajid Ali Shah ascended the throne of Oudh at a time when the East India Company was determined to annex the throne of prosperous Awadh, which was \"the garden, granary, and queen-province of India\"- the royal predecessors and successors of Awadh were one of the major threats to the dominance of the Mughal Empire before the arrival of the East India Company to the Indian subcontinent.In different circumstances perhaps, he might have succeeded as a ruler because he had many qualities that make a good administrator. He was generous, kind and compassionate towards his subjects, besides being one of the most magnanimous and passionate patrons of fine arts in the Indian tradition. When he ascended the throne, he took keen interest in the administration of justice, introduced reforms, and reorganised the military. Wajid Ali Shah was widely regarded as a debauched and detached ruler, but some of his notoriety seems to have been misplaced. The main cause for condemnation comes from the British Resident of Lucknow, General William Sleeman, who submitted a report highlighting \"maladministration\" and \"lawlessness\" he described as prevailing there, although Sleeman himself was strictly opposed to outright annexation for a variety of reasons, including political, financial and ethical ones.This provided the British with the facade of benevolence they were looking for, and formed the official basis for their annexation. Recent studies have, however, suggested that Oudh was neither as bankrupt nor as lawless as the British had claimed. In fact, Oudh was for all practical purposes under British rule well before the annexation, with the Nawab playing little more than a titular role. The Bengal presidency army was recruited largely from Oudh; while, under direction by the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie in 1855, any tax revenue from Oudh not required for state government costs was appropriated by the East India Company.In his book \"Awadh Under Wajid Ali Shah\", Dr. G.D. Bhatnagar gives the following assessment of this ill-starred prince:\n\n\n== Patron of the arts ==\n\n\n=== Contributions to music ===\nA large number of composers who thrived under the lavish patronage of the Nawab rulers of Lucknow enriched the light classical form of thumri; most prominent among these was Wajid Ali Shah. He was not only a munificent patron of music, dance, drama, and poetry but was himself a gifted composer. He had received vocal training under great Ustads like Basit Khan, Pyar Khan and Jafar Khan. Pyar Khan, Jafar Khan and Basit Khan were the direct descendants of Mian Tansen and were the sons of famous tanseni Chajju Khan.Bahadur Hussain Khan was the favourite musician of the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Bahadur Hussain Khan was the descendant of Tansen's son-in-law Naubat Khan.Although Wajid Ali Shah's pen-name was \"Qaisar\", he used pseudonym \"Akhtarpiya\" for his numerous compositions. Under this pen name, he wrote over forty works \u2013 poems, prose and thumris. Diwan-i-Akhtar, Husn-i-Akhtar contain his ghazals. He is said to have composed many new ragas and named them Jogi, Juhi, Shah-Pasand, etc.\nThe source for much information on music in Nawabi Lucknow comes from the text Ma\u2019danul Moosiqui ('The Mine of Music') of Hakim Mohammed Karam Imam, courtier of Wajid Ali Shah. During his time, complicated ragas like hori and dhrupad were ignored and easier raginis like tilak, pilu, sendura, khammach, bhairvi and jhanjhauti were encouraged. As these were liked by the king and easily understood by all sections of society, they came to be well-loved by commoners. Wajid Ali Shah has been accused of cheapening the classical tradition and promoting lighter forms of music such as ghazals and thumris. But then, as argued by scholars like Ravi Bhatt, this is how popular music has always been criticised. Popular belief has it that the light classical form, thumri was created by Wajid Ali Shah.\nHowever, James Kippen argued that evidence suggests thumri had almost certainly already become an independent vocal form somewhat influenced by khayal by 1800, becoming extremely popular and pervasive in the time of Wajid Ali Shah. Wajid Ali wrote and performed ghazals, and the modern-day style of ghazals was certainly evolved by his innovative ideas and experimentations in ghazals, some of which were noted for their inclusion of obscenities and sexually explicit references to his own private life.\n\n\n=== Contributions to dance: Kathak ===\nTogether with music, dance in Lucknow developed strongly and became a pre-eminent art under the patronage of Wajid Ali Shah. In the ancient times Kathak being the part of the temple ritual was performed at temples. With the change of time the Kathak performers in search of better prospects and rich patronage left the temple and entered into royal courts. The transformation was inevitable. The dance started adapting itself to the demands of the court, but it was under the artistic guidance and patronage of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, that Kathak achieved greater dimensions.\nHe gave a definite form, made it more artistic, and gave to it an aesthetic touch, he enriched it with rasa and bhava, and he added literature to it, lent it sensuality, and furnished it with grandeur and splendor to its presentation, argued Abdul Halim Sharar. During this period, Kathak was also extensively performed by tawaifs, who themselves developed the art in parallel to its refinement in court. They frequently performed on lighter classical music of such as dadra, kajri and tappa as well as thumri. Given the tawaifs' environment, their performance style of Kathak also differed from the court style, involving more of what in Kathak is termed nakhra (mischievous playfulness).Wajid Ali Shah started two distinct forms one is Rahas and the other one is called Raas. He himself choreographed a dance based on the moves of Kathak called, Rahas, that he danced himself with the ladies of his court. For him, Rahas was a dramatic form of theatre including acting, dancing, and music and with different scenes the whole setting and locale changes. On the other hand, Raas was purely a religious form. Primarily Dhrupad was sung in Raas and the performance began with its singing. Raas was a circular form of dance where many gopis danced with one Krishna. Radhakamal Mukerjee in his book, The Lord of the Autumn Moons, says that the Raspancadhyayi or the five chapters pertaining to the circular group dance of Krishna with the Gopis, distill the embody the full maturity of the mystical emotions.Kathak dance attained new heights of popularity and glory under his expert guidance and lavish patronage. Thakur Prasadji was his Kathak guru, and the unforgettable Kalka-Binda brothers performed in his court. What with the grand pageantry of the Rahas, Jogiya Jashan, Dance-dramas, and Kathak performances, Lucknow became the magnetic cultural centre where the most reputed musicians, dancers and poets of the time flourished. The greatest musicians, dancers and instrumentalists of the time enjoyed his munificent patronage and hospitality. It was at his reign that Lucknow Gharana came into existence. It was in this period that the Lucknow Gharana of Kathak attained maturity, through the efforts of the stalwarts like Thakur Prasadji and others. The Lucknow style of Kathak dance is characterized by graceful movements, elegance and natural poise with dance. Abhinaya, concern for movement shape and creative improvisations are the hallmarks of this style. He not only made Kathak as the official court dance, but using it in performances of rahas made it popular among the people.\n\n\n=== Contributions to Hindustani theatre ===\nWhen Wajid Ali Shah was a young boy, some astrologers warned his parents that he would become a Yogi, and advised them that the boy should be dressed up as a Yogi on each birthday of his so as to counteract the effect of the evil stars. He established the famous Parikhaana (abode of fairies) in which hundreds of beautiful and talented girls were taught music and dancing by expert-teachers engaged by the royal patron. These girls were known as Paris (fairies) with names such as Sultan pari, Mahrukh pari and so on. On each birthday, the Nawab would dress up as a Yogi with saffron robes, ash of pearls smeared on his face and body, necklaces of pearls around his neck, and a rosary in his hand, and walk pompously into the court with two of his 'paris dressed up as Jogans. Gradually he made it into a spectacular pageant or Mela known as Jogia Jashan, in which all citizens of Lucknow could participate, dressed as Yogis, irrespective of caste and creed. Later, when his favourite venue, the Qaisarbagh Baradari was built, he began to stage his magnificent Rahas (a Persianised name for Rasleela) full of sensuous poetry, his own lyrical compositions and glamorous Kathak dances.Ranbir Singh gives details of Wajid Ali Shah's book entitled Bani in which the author mentions 36 types of Rahas all set in Kathak style (with colourful names like Mor-Chchatr, Ghunghat, Salami, Mor Pankhi and Mujra), and gives exhaustive notes about the costumes, jewellery, and stage- craft. Rahas, prepared at a fabulous cost of several lakhs (hundred thousands) of rupees, became very popular, and was performed at the Kaisarbagh-Rahas Manzil, (most probably the first Hindustani Theatre Hall). Many have regarded Wajid Ali Shah as \"the first playwright of the Hindustani theatre\", because his \"Radha Kanhaiyya Ka Qissa\" staged in the Rahas Manzil was the first play of its kind. It featured the Goddess Radha, Lord Krishna, several sakhis, and a Vidushaka-like character named \"Ramchera\". Songs, dances, mime, and drama were all delightfully synthesised in these Rahas performances. He dramatised many other poems such as Darya-i-Tashsq, Afsane-i-Isbaq, and Bhahar-i-Ulfat. It is said that Amanat's Inder Sabha was inspired by these dance-dramas, written, produced and staged by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah.\n\n\n=== Contributions to literature ===\n\nLike the performing arts Wajid Ali Shah also patronised literature and several poets and writers in his court. Notable among them were 'Barq', 'Ahmad Mirza Sabir', 'Mufti Munshi', and 'Aamir Ahmad Amir', who wrote books at the orders of Wajid Ali Shah, Irshad-us-Sultan and Hidayat-us-Sultan, Amanat the famous author of Indra Sabha and Bekhud wrote Jalwa-Akhatar, Hajjo Sharaf and Afsana-i-Lucknow have presented a picture of the times and life of Wajid Ali Shah. The famous poet Mirza Ghalib also received the gracious patronage of Wajid Ali Shah, who granted him a pension of Rupees five hundred per year in 1854.Wajid Ali Shah used to write himself and was a poet of a considerable merit. He used to write under the nom-de-plume of \u2018Akhtar\u2019. He had equal command over Persian and Urdu and wrote several books in both languages. According to his court chronicler Masih-ud-Din he received a liberal western education and was well versed in ancient and modern history and literature. Garcin de Tassy, while travelling in the sub-continent during the mid-nineteenth century wrote in his journal about Wajid Ali Shah and noted, \"I do not have to appreciate here this very political resolution, neither do I have to appreciate the qualities or defects of Wajid Ali Shah, as a sovereign, but I am interested in him as a distinguished scholar and as eminent poet in Hindustani\".Wajid Ali Shah wrote extensively and adopted a simple language that easily conveyed meaning to all. It showed sprinkling of Awadhi, the local dialect. He was a prolific writer. His work Sawat-ul-Qalub runs into 1061 pages and comprises a collection of 44,562 couplets, and was completed in a short span of three years.\n\n\n==== Notable works ====\nAbdul Lais Siddiqi in Lucknow Ka Dabistan-i-Shairi noted that it was common for kings to employ poets to write on their behalf but this was not true of Wajid Ali Shah, and every single word has been written by himself and no one else. One of his most important works is the autobiographical Huzn-i-Akhtar, which is in verse and contains nearly 1276 couplets. It is faithful records of the hazardous journey that he undertook from Lucknow to Calcutta, after having relinquished his crown. It speaks of the unkind and unceremonious treatment accorded to him by the British authorities. Vivid details of the people and the places he encountered on his journey. It also evokes his desperation at his arrest and subsequent deportment to Calcutta's Matiya Burj. Another important work of his is Bani which runs into 400 pages.\nIt is a treatise on Music and Dance, which offers details of the mushairas held at Matiya Burj, of the buildings raised there at his command. There are also descriptions of the animals at his personal zoo, besides vignettes of life and the time at Matiya Burj. Although it is estimated that he wrote over 60 books but most of his works are not available and hence no critical assessment of his writing has been made till date.\n\n\n== Exile years ==\nAfter losing the kingdom, the King first went to Kanpur and then progressed to Calcutta in a steamer accompanied by his close relatives and large entourage comprising musicians, nautch girls, cooks and animals from his menagerie and came ashore at Bichali Ghat near Metiabruz, Calcutta on 13 May 1856.He had made up his mind to go and plead his case to Queen Victoria because of his firm belief in the British sense of justice. However, his physicians did not think his health would permit such a long voyage and it was his mother, brother and heir apparent who left for England. A year later when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 spread to Lucknow and rebelling sepoys;; installed one of his sons to the throne of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah was imprisoned in Fort William by the British along with his Prime Minister, due to apprehensions that he would become a rallying figure for the sepoys.\nHEA Cotton wrote that on Panic Sunday (14 June 1857), there was widespread apprehension among the European inhabitants of Kolkata because he had \"one, two, three thousand\" (no one knew) armed men under him. The suppression of the Indian Rebellion by the British Army dashed all his hopes of returning to Lucknow. After his release from Fort William, he was allotted a building called BNR House in Garden Reach near the headquarter of South Eastern Railway, Calcutta. In those days, it is said, it was called Parikhana.However, heartbroken after leaving Lucknow, he had carried his dear city in his heart and proceeded to carve out a miniature of Lucknow in Metiabruz. In his exile in Metiabruz, he tried to keep the sweet memories of his Lucknow era alive by recreating the musical environments of his Kaisarbagh Baradari. The banished king had been \"given\" a number of fine houses with vast grounds stretching along the banks of the river Hooghly three to four miles south of Kolkata. Because of the presence there of an earthen dome (or raised platform), people would refer to it as Matiya Burj. The king spent lavishly out of his income of 12 lakhs (or, 1.2 million) rupees per annum and before long a \"second Lucknow\" arose in this area.\n\n\n== Legacy: \"Babul Mora\" Thumri ==\nHis bhairavi thumri Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaay has been sung by several prominent singers, but a particularly popular rendition remembered today was performed by Kundan Lal Saigal for the 1930s movie Street Singer.\nIn a strange manner, this sad song epitomizes the pain and agony of the poet king himself when he was exiled from his beloved Lucknow.\n\n\n=== Devanagari lyrics ===\n\u092c\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e, \u0928\u0948\u0939\u0930 \u091b\u0942\u091f\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u090f \n\u092c\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e, \u0928\u0948\u0939\u0930 \u091b\u0942\u091f\u094b \u0939\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u090f\n\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u093f\u0932, \u092e\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0921\u094b\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0938\u091c\u093e\u0935\u0947\u0902 \n\u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e \u0905\u092a\u0928\u093e \u092c\u0947\u0917\u093e\u0928\u093e \u091b\u0942\u091f\u094b \u091c\u093e\u090f | \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e ...\n\u0905\u0902\u0917\u0928\u093e \u0924\u094b \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092c\u0924 \u092d\u092f\u093essss \u0914\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0939\u0930\u0940 \u092d\u092f\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0926\u0947\u0938 \n\u091c\u093e\u090f \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0932 \u0918\u0930 \u0906\u092a\u0928\u094b \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u091a\u0932\u0940 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0938 | \u092c\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0932 \u092e\u094b\u0930\u093e ...\n\n\n=== Urdu lyrics ===\n \u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u060c \u0646\u06cc\u06c1\u0631 \u0686\u06be\u064f\u0648\u0679\u0648 \u06c1\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0626\u06d2  \u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u060c \u0646\u06cc\u06c1\u0631 \u0686\u06be\u064f\u0648\u0679\u0648 \u06c1\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0626\u06d2  \n\u0686\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u06c1\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0650\u0644\u060c \u0645\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0688\u0648\u0644\u0650\u06cc\u0627 \u0633\u062c\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u06ba (\u0627\u064f\u0679\u06be\u0627\u06cc\u0651\u06ba) \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u064e\u067e\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0686\u06be\u064f\u0648\u0679\u0648 \u062c\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u060c \u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627\u06d4\u06d4\u06d4 \n \u0622\u06ba\u06af\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0648 \u067e\u0631\u0628\u062a \u0628\u06be\u06cc\u0648 \u0627\u0624\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u06c1\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u06be\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0650\u062f\u06cc\u0634  \u062c\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0644 \u06af\u06be\u0631 \u0622\u067e\u0646\u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0686\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0651\u0627 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062f\u06cc\u0634 \u060c \u0628\u0627\u0628\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u06d4\u06d4\u06d4\n\nThe thumri refers to his exile.

He died at Marylebone in November 1887, following an 'accidental' discharge from his shotgun. He was known to frequent the male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street, which was popular with members of high society including royalty and nobility, and was two years after his death the centre of the Cleveland Street scandal. Rumours persisted that his death was a suicide relating to his homosexuality.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlgernon Haskett-Smith at ESPNcricinfo"

Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one inning per team, having a limit in the number of overs, currently 50 overs per innings \u2013 although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs. ODI matches are a subset of List A cricket and so records and statistics are recorded both for specifically for ODIs and within List A. The earliest match recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971; since when there have been over 4,000 ODIs played by 28 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue with the increased popularity of cricket, a process that dates from the time of the Packer Revolution.\nIn ODIs playing 200  matches is considered to be a significant achievement. Allan Border of Australia was the first cricketer to have reached this landmark. \nSachin Tendulkar of India has played in most ODIs, having represented India in 463 matches.\nAs of 2 March 2021, 83 cricketers have reached this landmark, including 15 from India, the most among all ODI-playing nations.\n\n\n== Players with 200+ ODI matches ==\nFollowing is the list of cricketers who have played 200 or more ODI matches.\n Still playing\n\n\n== By country ==\n\n\n== References =="

The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. Starting from the format's inception in 2005, T20I status only applied to Full Members and some Associate Member teams. However, in April 2018, the ICC announced that it would grant T20I status to all its 105 members from 1 January 2019.\nThe shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game, and was not intended to be played internationally, but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005 when Australia defeated New Zealand, and the first tournament was played two years later, with the introduction of the ICC T20 World Cup. In 2016, for the first time in a calendar year, more Twenty20 International matches (100) were played than ODI matches (99). As of 3 May 2019, 80 nations feature in ICC T20I team rankings.As of 5 September 2021, 98 cricketers have reached this landmark, including 15 from Pakistan, the most among all T20I-playing nations.\n\n\n== Players with 50+ T20I matches ==\nFollowing is the list of cricketers who have played 50 or more T20I matches.\n Still playing\n\n\n== References =="

        "article": "Saradaranjan Ray (26 May 1858 \u2013 30 October 1925) was an Indian teacher of mathematics and Sanskrit who worked at Aligarh University and at Calcutta. He was also a cricket enthusiast and promoter who has been called the \"W.G. Grace of India\" and as the father of cricket in Bengal. He founded \"The Town Club\", a cricket club in Calcutta that played against European teams in the Eden Gardens from 1895. He was a paternal grand-uncle of Satyajit Ray.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSaradaranjan was one of five siblings born to Kalinath and Joytara who came from a wealthy Mymensingh family. Kalinath (died 1879) also called Shyamsundar Munshi knew Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, and served as an assistant to the deputy magistrate of Mymensingh. Saradaranjan was educated in Dhaka where he took an interest in cricket and along with his brothers Upendrakishore, Muktidaranjan, Kuladaranjan and Pramodaranjan they founded the Dhaka College Cricket Club. He received a BA in 1878. He then received an MA from Calcutta in 1879 and joined the Aligarh Anglo-Oriental College as a mathematics teacher. He also taught Sanskrit and took a keen interest in sport. He was known to be physically violent and temperamental. On one occasion his son brought home a goat that disturbed him with its bleating causing him to beat the goat to death. Another time, an English soldier in a train annoyed him by putting his leg up on the seat next to him. After the man refused to heed his requests, he reportedly grabbed the man and pulled him onto the floor.  Saradaranjan moved to Berhampore to teach and then went to Dhaka College for a brief stint before moving to Cuttack. He was then invited by Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar to join the Metropolitan Institution where Saradaranjan joined in 1888, becoming a vice principal in 1892 and principal from 1909 until his death.\n\n\n== Publishing and sports goods ==\nAfter the death of Vidyasagar in 1891, the Metropolitan Institution ran into financial difficulties and Saradaranjan did not have a salary. He sought incomes from writing books, mainly commentaries in English on various Sanskrit works. He also conducted tutorials from 1895 charging 100 to 200 rupees per week. He established a printing and sports goods company, S. Ray and Company in 1898 along with his brother in law Hemendramohan Bose through which he published the first cricket manual in Bengali in 1899. The company was quite well known in the period and  He designed a cricket bat that won a medal in the Indian Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition at Calcutta in 1906. He took a keen interest in fishing, designing baitless hooks and other gear which he sold through his company. Apart from cricket, he also took an interest in football, serving as the first president for the East Bengal Football Club.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRay, Saradaranjan (1918) Kalidasa's Kumarasambhavam.
